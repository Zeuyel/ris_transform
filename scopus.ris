AB  - The global electric vehicle (EV) market has experienced considerable growth over the last several decades to meet the demand for lower emissions and achieve sustainable development goals. This study considers the remanufactured electric vehicle battery (EVB) supply chain under government subsidies and carbon trading policies. The Stackelberg game theory model was used, in which four decision makers were specified to follow a given sequence. Regular EVB suppliers make decisions based on that of green EVB suppliers to finalize EVB wholesale prices, whereas EV manufacturers and third parties make decisions based on EV selling and return prices to maximize their profits. The results show that carbon trading regulations are important for managing carbon emissions and do not increase the return rate and remanufactured EVB production volume. Moreover, green suppliers obtain a higher profit under government subsidies, which leads to increased EVB return rates and reduces the market price and cost of materials. The total carbon emissions were reduced significantly by combining regular and recycled materials, which demonstrates that remanufacturing operations are among the most efficient methods of mitigating the environmental impacts of used batteries. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the current time the climate change risk has continued to intensify such that sustainability of the world is difficult, hence urgent emission mitigation actions. An in-depth analysis of GHG emission reduction policies is provided in this paper, with a focus on strategies involving technology, policy, society, and the economy. Regulations play a significant role in reducing the amount of carbon in the atmosphere, which gives a framework for the development of incentives for all sectors. The social cost of carbon is internalized by carbon pricing strategies like carbon taxes and cap-and-trade programs, which promote businesses to invest in greener practices and technological advances. Based on market structures, standards for energy efficiency and mandates for emissions targets may act as catalysts for changes in the market that push towards such low-carbon options. If a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from major economic sectors like agriculture, industry, transportation, or energy is to be achieved, technological advancement will continue to be crucial. Consequently, renewables including solar power wind turbine systems and hydroelectricity plus others replaced fossil fuelled-based sources thereby reducing emission in generation of electrical power. Further, this is to be achieved through efforts in grid modernization, smart infrastructural development and energy storage facilitating the penultimate connection of vast amount of renewable power to electricity grids especially during peak times. Again, industrial sector seems promising as far as decarbonizing production processes and reducing emissions are concerned by adopting clean technologies such as carbon capture and storage (CCS), electrification and sustainable manufacturing processes. Additionally, changes that result into modification in the transport sector like electric vehicles expansion of public transportation systems, promotion of active transport modes amongst others also reduces emission levels whilst enhancing air quality. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy through financing will therefore require significant mobilization of investments towards clean energy infrastructure, sustainable land use practices and climate-resilient development. To direct capital towards low-carbon investment green bonds, carbon markets and public-private partnerships provide innovative financing mechanisms.  © 2024 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - This study explores the design of a cost-effective climate policy mix for transition toward net-zero emissions in the mid-term (by 2035). Its novelty lies in the methodological advancements through the development of a soft-linking procedure that integrates a top-down computable general equilibrium model with a bottom-up energy system model. The integrated assessment focuses on the climate policy mix under the framework of Taiwan’s Climate Change Response Act passed in 2023. The analysis shows that a policy mix combining investments in energy transition with user-pay hybrid pricing measures can facilitate cost-effective mitigation and enhance public acceptance. The proposed hybrid pricing includes cost-based electricity pricing and a two-step carbon pricing strategy that encourages early action (before 2030) for larger emitters. Finally, we demonstrate that accelerating the transition is crucial, as it reduces the economic costs of meeting emission targets by inducing further investments in energy efficiency improvement and lowering the carbon pricing levels required to close the abatement gap. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Carbon price prediction can help participants keep abreast of carbon market dynamics and develop trading strategies. It is challenging for statistical models to accurately capture the nonlinear characteristics of the carbon pricing, and machine learning methods need sophisticated artificial feature engineering. To successfully address these drawbacks, our research suggests a carbon price forecasting model built on a deep learning architecture. Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise decomposes historical price to obtain Intrinsic Mode Function and Principal Component Analysis reduces the dimensionality of each influential factor. Dual-Stage Attention-Based Recurrent Neural Network, a Seq2Seq model, made up of an encoder with feature attention and a decoder with temporal attention, is employed to predicted price of the Hubei Carbon Emissions Allowance. The dual-attention mechanism enables preprocessing to be done adaptively and more effectively than manual processing. As shown by statistical analysis and grey correlation analysis, Hubei Carbon Emissions Allowance has a high autocorrelation, and the carbon market, energy and industry, economy, and environment have high to low correlations on it. The accuracy metrics of this framework, Mean Absolute Error = 0.75, Mean Absolute Percentage Error = 1.59 and Root Mean Squared Error = 1.28, are lower than compared models. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Renewable energy is considered to be sustainable solution to the energy crisis and climate change. The transition to renewable energy needs to be considered on a sectoral basis and one such sector that can potentially decarbonized with renewable energy is the telecommunication sector. Several base transceiver stations (BTS) in remote regions have unstable electric supply systems. Diesel generators (DG) are a common solution to energy problems on such telecommunication sites. However, they have high fuel costs on the global market and contribute to high carbon emissions. Hybrid renewable energy systems may provide a stable power output by integrating multiple energy sources, essential for supplying a dependable and uninterrupted power supply in the context of the telecom sector, notably base transceiver stations (BTS). Deploying such a system might also help BTS, which relies mainly on diesel generators with battery storage backup, reduce operational costs and environmental problems. This study presents the framework for large-scale photovoltaic system penetration based on techno-economic analysis (based on actual on ground data with least assumptions) in base transceiver stations (BTS) encapsulating telecom sector spread across various geographical regions. The proposed framework includes a mathematical model complemented with system design in HOMER software tool. The techno-economic aspects of the study were spread across 2, 12 and 263 sites, along with comparison analysis of photovoltaic system installation with and without energy storage devices, respectively. The sites included both on-grid and off-grid sites, which were exposed to high levels of power outages and subjected to reliance on costly and environmentally hazardous diesel generators. Optimization results showed that the photovoltaic system with a diesel generator and battery storage system provide a promising solution to the energy problem, with an average decrease in LCOE of 29%, DG hour’s reduction by 82% with 92% reduction in carbon emission and a reduction in NPC of 34% due to the high availability of solar. The techno-economic analysis indicated that optimized photovoltaic system and storage results in both on–off grid BTS sites with better options, amid low cost of energy and free accessibility of solar. Moreover, the results spread across geographical regions aiming at a reliable and environmentally friendly option that reduces load on utility grid across on-grid BTS sites and substantial overall reduction in diesel usage. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - In recent years, the reduction of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) emissions has been desired due to the global warming issue. Therefore, it is important for consumers to accurately understand the CO2 emissions of the electricity they purchase from the power grid and to make efforts for low-carbon use of electricity. In this study, we propose a low-carbon operation of smart house based on dynamic CO2 emissions intensity created by considering the power generation status of the power grid. The optimization problem is mathematically modeled using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) and solved using the MATLAB toolbox. Simulation results show that the proposed method using Realtime Pricing (RTP) reflecting electricity market prices reduces CO2 emissions and operating costs by 15.85% and 16.96%, compared to the conventional method based on conventional CO2 emissions intensity using Time-of-use (TOU) tariffs.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) regulates CO2 emissions from the power sector in the northeastern states of the U.S. Its effectiveness has been criticized due to the low CO2 allowance price and limited price variation, especially in the early years. Using a model that accounts for intertemporal constraints, this paper studies how firms react to weak CO2 emission regulations. The results show that the RGGI policy has helped decrease the total CO2 emissions by at least 4.73%. An additional $1/ton increase in permit price reduces the total CO2 emissions by 1.85%. CO2 can be reduced by 23.50% if carbon is priced at $15/ton. Slight evidence of fuel switching from coal to natural gas is found. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Electric Vehicles (EVs) have emerged in smart cities as one of the prominent solutions to improve environmental protection and reduce carbon gas emissions. However, with limited charging stations and battery life, EV owners are not inclined to cover long distances. So, Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2V) has been introduced lately for energy sharing among EVs through the wireless power transfer (WPT) mechanism in the Internet of EVs (IoEV) environment. But the existing approaches suffered from security and privacy issues along with single-point-of-failure with energy trading between EVs. So, in this paper, we propose a blockchain-based V2V wireless energy sharing scheme, i.e., V2V-ES, to ensure secure transactions among EVs in the WPT process. First, the energy sharing is executed in a clustered IoEV environment, where block generation, validator selection, and PoA consensus processes are performed in every cluster. Next, the Bayesian game-based mechanism is adopted for optimal energy price in the IoEV environment. Here, a linear equilibrium strategy is obtained for optimal pricing that maximizes the utilities of both energy buyer and seller in the energy sharing process and increases social welfare. The game-based pricing is achieved through dedicated smart contracts (SCs) to guarantee trustworthiness, reliability, and security. Finally, the simulation results show the proposed V2V-ES scheme reduces the buyer's costs by 16% and increases the seller's utility by 19%. Moreover, the effectiveness of V2V-ES scheme is compared with benchmark approaches based on various parameters like network latency, system throughput, and optimal transaction price. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This paper introduces a cutting-edge deep learning-based model aimed at enhancing the short-term performance of microgrids by simultaneously minimizing operational costs and emissions in the presence of distributed energy resources. The primary focus of this research is to harness the potential of demand response programs (DRPs), which actively engage a diverse range of consumers to mitigate uncertainties associated with renewable energy sources (RES). To facilitate an effective demand response, this study presents a novel incentive-based payment strategy packaged as a pricing offer. This approach incentivizes consumers to actively participate in DRPs, thereby contributing to overall microgrid optimization. The research conducts a comprehensive comparative analysis by evaluating the operational costs and emissions under scenarios with and without the integration of DRPs. The problem is formulated as a challenging mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem, demanding a robust optimization technique for resolution. In this regard, the multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm is employed to efficiently address this intricate problem. To showcase the efficacy and proficiency of the proposed methodology, a real-world smart microgrid case study is chosen as a representative example. The obtained results demonstrate that the integration of deep learning-based demand response with the incentive-based pricing offer leads to significant improvements in microgrid performance, emphasizing its potential to revolutionize sustainable and cost-effective energy management in modern power systems. Key numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. In the case study, the implementation of our demand response strategy results in a cost reduction of 12.5% and a decrease in carbon emissions of 14.3% compared to baseline scenarios without DR integration. Furthermore, the optimization model shows a notable increase in RES utilization by 22.7%, which significantly reduces reliance on fossil fuel-based generation. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - A matter of debate in climate policy is whether lawmakers should rely on carbon pricing or regulations, such as low-carbon standards, to reach emission reduction goals. Past research showed that pricing is more cost-effective. However, previous work studied the two policies when implemented separately, in effect comparing two policy extremes. In contrast, we explore the full spectrum of climate policy mixes that include both types of policies but vary in how much they rely on each. We do this both analytically by extending previous theory and numerically with two energy system models. In line with past work, increasing reliance on pricing increases the cost-effectiveness of the policy mix. However, we show that this benefit exhibits diminishing marginal returns. Thus the gain in cost-effectiveness from complementing stringent standards with modest pricing is relatively large. Our results show that relying on pricing for 20% of emission reductions (and on a standard for 80%) reduces costs by 32%–57% compared to a standard-only approach. Importantly, trading off more of the standard for pricing delivers smaller and smaller gains in cost-effectiveness. For example, a policy mix that relies on each policy for 50% of emission reductions decreases costs by 60%–81%, which is already 71%–88% as cost-effective as the theoretically most cost-effective pricing-only policy. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - As the three major greenhouse gas emitters in Northeast Asia (NEA), China, South Korea, and Japan, have joined the global carbon neutrality movement, this study examines interstate power transmissions between the countries to be considered for optimal technology pathways towards the net zero emission target. Using a bottom-up least-cost energy system model, intertemporal investment decisions are made between 2015 and 2065 in 10-year time steps subject to short-term/long-term emission targets in a range of carbon prices (0,100,200,300 USD/tCO2). Results show that under the carbon neutrality target, interstate power trade enables earlier carbon phaseout at a lower cost by increasing renewables utilizations and reduces investment burdens for high-cost carbon-neutral technologies like hydrogen. We find grid interconnections increase renewable penetrations at all nodes, while carbon pricing above 200 USD/tCO2 is required to ensure all participating nodes benefit from earlier carbon reduction. Ambitious carbon pricing is also important for closing gaps in emission impacts of short-term and long-term emission targets, calling for urgent actions to remove market distortion in power sectors. Lastly, sensitivity analysis to trade limits and nuclear utilization shows trade makes a greater contribution to carbon phaseout with relaxed trade terms and nuclear deployment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - As the global environmental pollution problem intensifies, the carbon reduction transformation of the power system is urgent. In order to solve the problem of unclear carbon flow and distribution in the operation of the power grid, as well as the mismatch between static time-of-use electricity prices and peak and valley periods in the scheduling of electric vehicle charging loads, a multiperiod dynamic electricity price guidance strategy based on carbon emission flow theory is proposed. First, based on the accurate power flow results of the power system, a complex power distribution matrix of the power system is constructed to obtain the distribution of the power generated by the generator units in each node of the network. Then, the Monte Carlo random sampling method is used to simulate the load situation of electric vehicles in a disordered charging state. A mathematical model based on the carbon trading model is established to minimize the load difference at the grid end and maximize the cost of charging on the user side. Finally, the proposed ordered charging method with a multiperiod dynamic electricity pricing strategy is compared with unordered charging, and considering the participation of electric vehicles in carbon trading, this strategy effectively reduces the peak valley difference between the power grid and user charging costs.

AB  - Climate change and related national mitigation targets make the decarbonization of the power sector an urgent need. The power sector faces the challenge of considering the design and interaction between emission reduction policies, which can sometimes counteract each other. This study proposes a framework that can be used to quantitatively study the qualitative link between carbon pricing and capacity pricing. The framework is validated through a case study in Hokkaido, Japan, and used to further investigate the interaction between the two policies through a System Dynamics simulation model and scenario design. The results indicate that a carbon price would promote the introduction of wind power, as well as the reduction in fossil fuels, while the capacity price will mitigate the boom-and-bust investment cycle and stabilize electricity prices. However, when the two policy-based prices act on the power system simultaneously, the advantages will be offset by each other. The existence of the capacity price partially offsets the emission reduction effect of the carbon price, and the carbon price with a lower floor will also indirectly squeeze the generation space of flexible power plants. In order to address these inefficiencies, this study proposed a capacity price focused on subsidizing flexible power plants and also coupled with a higher floor carbon price, which results in a consistent incentive. It also promotes the decommissioning of carbon-intensive base-load power plants and reduces CO2 emissions significantly. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Most of the energy produced in the world is consumed by commercial and residential buildings. With the growth in the global economy and world demographics, this energy demand has become increasingly important. This has led to higher unit electricity prices, frequent stresses on the main electricity grid and carbon emissions due to inefficient energy management. This paper presents an energy-consumption management system based on time-shifting of loads according to the dynamic day-ahead electricity pricing. This simultaneously reduces the electricity bill and the peaks, while maintaining user comfort in terms of the operating waiting time of appliances. The proposed optimization problem is formulated mathematically in terms of multi-objective integer non-linear programming, which involves constraints and consumer preferences. For optimal scheduling, the management problem is solved using the hybridization of the particle swarm optimization algorithm and the branch-and-bound algorithm. Two techniques are proposed to manage the trade-off between the conflicting objectives. The first technique is the Pareto-optimal solutions classification using supervised learning methods. The second technique is called the lexicographic method. The simulations were performed based on residential building energy consumption, time-of-use pricing (TOU) and critical peak pricing (CPP). The algorithms were implemented in Python. The results of the current work show that the proposed approach is effective and can reduce the electricity bill and the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) by 28% and 49.32%, respectively, for the TOU tariff rate, and 48.91% and 47.87% for the CPP tariff rate by taking into account the consumer's comfort level. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Sharing rides emits less carbon per capita than private ride-hailing. This paper presents a pricing method to attract more users from solo ride-hailing to shared rides and reduce total carbon emissions. The pricing method includes offering incentives for shared rides and collecting extra fees for exclusive ride-hailing. We designed a mechanism that all extra fees from exclusive ride-hailing subsidize the incentives for shared rides, resulting in fewer per-capita emissions. A binary logit model is constructed to embody how the incentives and extra fees affect users’ choices toward ride-sharing and exclusive ride-hailing. We measure the overall carbon emissions reduction if shifting riders from exclusive ride-hailing to shared rides in a ridesourcing instance. We ascertain the extent of choice utility impacted by incentives and fees through an SP survey. Results show that the proposed mechanism effectively reduces the total carbon emissions of the online ride-hailing instance by 20%−25% and suggest that people are more sensitive to extra fees than incentives. © ASCE.

AB  - Integrating innovation and environmental responsibility has become important in pursuing sustainable industrial practices in the contemporary world. These twin imperatives have stimulated research into developing methods that optimize industrial processes, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness while mitigating undesirable ecological impacts. This objective is exemplified by the emergence of biochar derived from the thermo-chemical transformation of biomass. This review examines biochar production methods and their potential applications across various aspects of the iron and steel industries (ISI). The technical, economic, and sustainable implications of integrating biochar into the ISI were explored. Slow pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization are the most efficient methods for higher biochar yield (25–90%). Biochar has several advantages- higher heating value (30–32 MJ/kg), more porosity (58.22%), and significantly larger surface area (113 m2/g) compared to coal and coke. However, the presence of biochar often reduces fluidity in a coal-biochar mixture. The findings highlighted that biochar production and implementation in ISI often come with higher costs, primarily due to the higher expense of substitute fuels compared to traditional fossil fuels. The economic viability and societal desirability of biochar are highly uncertain and vary significantly based on factors such as location, feedstock type, production scale, and biochar pricing, among others. Furthermore, biomass and biochar supply chain is another important factor which determines its large scale implementation. Despite these challenges, there are opportunities to reduce emissions from BF-BOF operations by utilizing biochar technologies. Overall, the present study explored integrating diverse biochar production methods into the ISI aiming to contribute to the ongoing research on sustainable manufacturing practices, underscoring their significance in shaping a more environmentally conscious future. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Climate finance and carbon pricing are regarded as sustainable policy mechanisms for mitigating negative environmental externalities via the development of green financing projects and the imposition of taxes on carbon pollution generation. Financial literacy indicates that it is beneficial to invest in cleaner technology to advance the environmental sustainability goal. The current wave of the COVID-19 epidemic has had a detrimental effect on the world economies’ health and income. The pandemic crisis dwarfs previous global financial crises in terms of scope and severity, collapsing global financial markets. The study’s primary contribution is constructing a climate funding index (CFI) based on four critical factors: inbound foreign direct investment, renewable energy usage, research and development spending, and carbon damages. In a cross-sectional panel of 43 nations, the research evaluates the effect of climate funding, financial literacy, and carbon pricing in lowering exposure to coronavirus cases. The study utilized Newton–Raphson and Marquardt steps to estimate the current parameter estimates while evaluating the COVID-19 prediction model with level regressors using the robust least squares regression model (S-estimator). Additionally, the innovation accounting matrix predicts estimations over a specific period. The findings indicate that climate finance significantly reduces coronavirus exposure by introducing green financing initiatives that benefit human health, which eventually strengthens the immune system’s ability to fight infectious illnesses. Financial literacy and carbon pricing, on the other hand, are ineffectual in controlling coronavirus infections due to rising economic activity and densely inhabited areas that enable the transmission of coronavirus cases across countries. Similar findings were obtained using the alternative regression apparatus. The COVID-19 predicted variable was used as a “response variable,” and climate financing was shown to have a favorable impact on containing coronavirus exposure. As shown by the innovation accounting matrix, carbon pricing would drastically decrease coronavirus cases’ exposure over a time horizon. The study concludes that climate finance and carbon pricing were critical in improving air quality indicators, which improved countries’ health and wealth, allowing them to reduce coronavirus infections via sustainable healthcare reforms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - The importance of energy conservation and emission reduction has become the consensus of the international community, and Iraq is also actively improving the urban public transportation system to control carbon emissions. This paper collects panel data of Tikrit city in Iraq in the past 3 years, constructs a random effect variable coefficient model, and studies the impact of the development of urban low-carbon transportation system on the energy consumption structure. The study finds that the government can use public transportation pricing strategies to influence consumers. In order to realize the optimization of energy consumption structure, the impact of electric vehicles on energy consumption structure will decrease with the increase of urban development. The transportation sector can increase the purchase and travel costs of traditional cars by restricting travel, purchases, and charging parking fees, which affects the number of private cars and reduces the obstacles to optimizing the energy consumption structure. The government should increase financial subsidies, improve rail transit and reasonable bus (electric) vehicle operation systems, increase investment in new energy vehicle research and development, and encourage high energy density and low power consumption technologies. development, increase residents’ demand for new energy passenger vehicles, and optimize the energy consumption structure. © 2023 by author(s).

AB  - This paper assesses how increased use of alternative fuels (ethanol and electricity) contributes to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions of light-duty vehicles in Rio Janeiro state (RJ), Brazil, a region of a developing country - most such analysis focus at the aggregate country level. Using an energy systems model (OSeMOSYS), we analyze scenarios that consider an improvement in the quality of the ethanol (in gCO2eq/MJ) consumed in RJ due to the development of the RenovaBio program, greater uptake of electric vehicles, carbon pricing, and a combination of these policies. We also analyze a scenario with the new RenovaBio targets, which the Brazilian government scaled down because of the COVID-19 pandemic. We find that electric vehicles are the most cost-effective policy to reduce CO2emissions (by 1.9%) when no carbon pricing is considered. When it is, however, CO2emissions are reduced the most (between 47% and 56%), regardless of the vehicle technology being used, but it is the costlier policy (between 5.4% and 15.3%). In scenarios with carbon pricing, flex-fuel vehicles switch to ethanol, an important result for a region where this technology already dominates the vehicle fleet. Greater uptake of electric vehicles leads to lower overall transportation costs (by 2.5%), but when a CO2price is considered, because the electricity system still relies on fossil fuels, the reduction in CO2emissions is compromised. In such a setting, increased ethanol quality reduces carbon emissions more than electric vehicle adoption (by 16%). The RenovaBio targets' reduction due to the COVID-19 pandemic, however, jeopardizes this result. Such findings convey important evidence to policymakers and the research community: decarbonization of transportation in a region of a developing country, where economic resources are scarcer, can start before electric vehicles become affordable by increasing and maintaining continued access to lower-carbon fuels. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

AB  - Industrialization has led to numerous environmental issues, prompting both industrialized and developing countries to adopt sustainable practices. This research investigates the impact of renewable energy and industrialization on the ecological footprint in Africa using the GMM method with data that span from 2006 to 2020 due to data availability. The findings reveal that renewable energy significantly reduces the level of ecological footprint, while industrialization raises it and thus detrimental to the environment. However, industrialization can enhance environmental sustainability if driven by renewable energy use since renewable energy has the potentials in contributing to sustainable development. It equally helps in mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and contributing to a cleaner environment. These results therefore underscore the importance of sustainable development and environmental protection in Sub Saharan Africa. The study thus recommends that African countries improve their industrial and institutional frameworks through policies that promote renewable energy investments, support domestic low-carbon technology for producers and phase out fossil fuel subsidies. Additionally, policymakers should implement carbon pricing to incentivize companies to adopt more sustainable practices. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - With the goal of 'carbon neutrality and carbon peaking', the electricity market is increasingly linked to the carbon trading market, and the reduction of carbon emissions through the adjustment of energy pricing mechanisms has become a new research direction. At the present stage, there are often multiple integrated energy micro-grids in the same region, with significant energy interaction between them. However, the difference in ownership makes the degree of cooperation between them to reduce carbon emissions different. Therefore, we first propose a low-carbon-efficient operation model for integrated energy micro-grids based on a hybrid (cooperative and non-cooperative) game. The game of integrated energy micro-grid clusters is then divided into two stages. The first stage is that the government can control the micro-grids to form a coalition and play an internal game. The second stage is an external game between the government micro-grid alliance and private micro-grids. Finally, the model is efficiently solved by an equilibrium constraint method of the phasmatodea population evolution algorithm to form a dynamic energy price mechanism. The results show that the mechanism formed promotes cooperation between integrated energy micro-grids, ensures the dominant position of the government micro-grid coalition in the multi-energy market, can effectively achieve carbon emission reduction, and reduces the total cost of operating the micro-grid cluster.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study proposes a master-slave game-based optimisation strategy for pricing and scheduling within integrated electric-heat energy systems. Initially, the transactional model between integrated energy operators and load aggregators is presented. Second, a master-slave game model for the integrated electricity-heat energy system is developed. The integrated energy operator assumes the role of leader, aiming to maximize revenue. To achieve this, carbon capture and power-to-gas technologies are introduced. Based on the energy usage strategies reported by users, the operator determines both the pricing strategy for end users and the output levels for each piece of equipment. The load aggregator, acting as a follower with the aim of maximising consumer surplus, takes into account both electrical and heat demand response from the customer side. It then optimises its own load power participating to the demand response based on the pricing strategy of the leader. Finally a distributed algorithm integrating a genetic algorithm with a CPLEX solver is employed to address the pricing strategy of an integrated energy operator and the energy consumption strategy of a load aggregator. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed effectively reduces system carbon emissions while effectively balancing the interests of both parties involved. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Trade reduces the effectiveness of climate policies such as carbon pricing when domestic products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports. We investigate the impact of unilateral carbon pricing on electricity generation in a country open to trade through interconnection lines. We characterize the energy mix with intermittent renewable sources of energy (wind or solar power). Electricity trade limits the penetration of renewables due to trade-induced competition. A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) removes this limit by increasing the cost of imported power, or by deterring imports. The CBAM must be complemented by a subsidy on renewables to increase renewable generation above domestic consumption. The interconnection line is then used to export power rather than importing it when renewables are producing. We also examine network pricing and investment into interconnection capacity. A higher carbon price increases interconnection investment which further reduces the effectiveness of carbon pricing. In contrast, when renewable electricity is exported, a higher subsidy on renewables reduces further carbon emissions by expanding interconnection capacity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The power supply and distribution of the 'Photovoltaic, Energy Storage, Direct Current and Flexibility (PEDF)' system in buildings is often challenged due to the temporal mismatch between electricity generation and consumption. The electricity supply of the PEDF system needs to be flexibly adjusted to accurately respond to load demand and decarbonize the building's operation, which poses challenges for power dispatching within the system. This study proposes a data-driven model predictive control optimization strategy, considering three representative electricity consumption scenarios for residential, commercial, and industrial sectors under two weather conditions (clear/cloudy). The proposed strategy aims to optimize carbon emissions and power purchase costs as primary objectives while incorporating Time-Of-Use pricing. The results demonstrate that across various scenarios, the optimized dispatch strategy significantly mitigates carbon emissions and reduces power purchase costs incurred by the system during daily operations compared to the conventional rule-based dispatch approach. These findings offer insights into promoting low-carbon buildings and fostering sustainable development in building energy.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - The urgent need to achieve the COP-27 targets has become evident due to the more frequent and severe climate-induced disasters and their socioeconomic consequences. The adverse effects of climate change highlight the need for an immediate shift away from fossil fuels without compromising economic development. Internalization of the negative externality in market transactions through the imposition of carbon pricing is widely touted as the most economically efficient means of solving this problem. This study, however, argues that crude oil price volatility could be an unintended consequence of carbon pricing. To this end, information flows between the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme and crude oil price volatility are examined through transfer entropy and wavelet-partial wavelet coherence analyses. Daily data from January 1, 2014 to July 1, 2023 are analyzed. The transfer entropy results show that information on carbon pricing reduces uncertainty about crude oil price volatility and vice versa, indicating that carbon pricing would be quite informative in building models to predict crude oil price volatility. The wavelet-partial coherence analyses reveal that the surge in carbon prices experienced in the late 2010s induced crude oil volatility, whereas the crude oil price volatility triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic forced carbon prices down. This study therefore identifies carbon price movements as a legitimate fear for policymakers, as it is a new source of volatility in conventional energy markets. Caution should thus be the watchword regarding optimal carbon pricing. Aiming to rapidly attain the full optimal carbon price is not recommended. Rapid changes in carbon prices will have strong redistributive implications across economies. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - Public buildings play a significant role in carbon emissions reduction and building energy conservation. This study establishes a simulation model for an existing public building in China's hot summer and cold winter areas. It applies the global sensitivity analysis model to obtain the optimally combined strategy of energy-saving renovation, including users' behavior and other parameters' changes. Finally, this study implements a time-of-use (TOU) pricing strategy through the demand response function, and obtains an optimization plan for energy conservation and CO2 emission reduction. Results show that in the combined strategy, on a typical day in summer, energy consumption, carbon emissions and energy expenditure of users are reduced by 24.5%. Moreover, in the TOU pricing strategy, the energy consumption and carbon emissions are reduced by 26.4%, and the energy expenditure of users is reduced by 26.1%. In summary, considering users' comfort, energy consumption, and economy, adopting the TOU pricing strategy is beneficial to load response and adjusting power supply volatility. Moreover, it reduces the electricity cost of users and the maintenance cost of the power supply bureau. This study provides new ideas for energy conservation and CO2 emissions reduction in existing public buildings. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The growing utilization of biomass feedstocks for climate change mitigation has led to increased research on biorefineries. Concurrently, environmental policies are evolving as crucial tools to address these global concerns. Cap-and-trade, carbon tax, and carbon cap policies have been established to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. In this work, a mathematical optimization model is developed to integrate biorefinery process design with carbon pricing policies and crediting mechanisms. A two-stage stochastic mixed integer linear programming model is proposed to account for emissions, feedstock supply, chemical demand, and pricing uncertainties. A bi-objective optimization framework is employed to consider economic and environmental metrics. The framework is a valuable tool for governments and businesses to determine pareto-optimal investment strategies under environmental policies. It is applicable for evaluating prospective chemical technologies with carbon pricing policies beyond biorefineries. The results indicate that carbon crediting mechanisms can minimize the financial penalty by up to 50% under a carbon tax policy. Implementing chemical demand constraints within a cap-and-trade policy reduces potential profits, especially when the carbon prices are high. The stochastic programming approach revealed that underestimating the expected carbon cap leads to lower expected profits. Despite the financial implications of these policies, profitable process designs are achievable. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The building sector is responsible for 16 % of GHG emissions in Germany and its contribution to meeting Germany's climate targets is correspondingly high. Effective climate protection in the building sector can only be achieved with a broad mix of instruments. One important instrument in this mix is CO2 pricing of fossil fuels. In Germany, a CO2 price for the building and transport sector was introduced at the beginning of 2021. This paper analyzes the social impacts of CO2 pricing in Germany and looks into alternative models for revenue recycling. We focus in particular on redistributing revenues by reducing the renewable energy surcharge and thus household electricity prices. Additionally, we consider how the impacts change when efficiency investments are taken in response to the pricing scheme. Our analysis shows that CO2 pricing in Germany in combination with revenue use for reducing electricity costs has clear positive distributional effects at the level of households. Limiting the pass-through of CO2 cost from landlords to tenants both reduces the burden on tenants and increases incentives for landlords to invest in energy-efficient refurbishments. For households in the first three income deciles, reductions in electricity cost outweigh the CO2 costs incurred. Although high-income households also benefit from an abolition of the renewable electricity surcharge, the costs incurred from CO2 pricing cannot be completely offset. We find, however, adjustment actions such as investing in more efficient, zero-carbon energy solutions results in net reductions also for these households. Besides limiting cost pass-through to tenants, we conclude that a carefully chosen approach for revenue recycling is important to protect vulnerable households. Taking into account the practical implementation as well as transaction costs, this results in a favourable assessment for electricity price reduction as a redistribution mechanism compared to a lump-sum rebate of the same revenue amount. These findings can inform the ongoing discussions of introducing an EU-wide carbon pricing mechanism for buildings and transport as proposed by the European Commission. © 2022 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

AB  - Carbon pricing policies can play an important role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. However, policymakers often cite the lack of public support as a major obstacle to adopting and expanding the coverage of such policies. Using data from a large cross-country survey of about 28,500 people across 28 countries conducted during the summer of 2022, we show that providing information about the costs and benefits of carbon pricing can swing public support. Highlighting the efficacy and revenue recycling potential of carbon pricing increases support, especially in emerging market economies. In contrast, highlighting costs reduces support, but less so for people who report being already significantly impacted by climate change. Moreover, people adopt more negative views of subsidies for renewable energy and low-carbon technologies when the salience of their costs is increased, with the shift being more pronounced for people, especially in advanced economies, who believe that effective climate polices require global efforts. Our results suggest that there is scope to increase public support for climate mitigation measures by providing people with the policy information they may lack. © 2024 International Monetary Fund.

AB  - Renewable energy sources (RES) and electric vehicles (EVs) are widely recognized as primary ways to reduce carbon emissions and essential components of low-carbon power systems. However, both of them have strong uncertainties which bring great challenges to power transactions and the operation of power grids. This paper defines the uncertainty cost of wind power producer(WPP) in day-ahead(DA) market pricing based on information entropy theory for the first time and proposes a EV charging management strategy with DA contract. The constructed low-carbon emission electricity market(LCEM) quantifies the uncertainty cost and contracts the disordered charging of EVs. It reduces the uncertainty and ensures the balance of power supply and demand. In addition, the transaction between WPP and EVs is described as the Stackelberg game, and its communication network is constructed through a blockchain network to ensure transaction efficiency and privacy security. Experiments show that LCEM can accurately measure the uncertainty of wind power generation, increase the net profit for WPP by more than 2% when the prediction error is greater than 10%, and adopt EV contract charging management in the DA market to minimize charging costs.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we consider the choice of remanufacturing strategy of a monopolist original equipment manufacturer under the cap-and-trade regulation in the presence of the assimilation effect. We model the manufacturer’s optimal decision-makings and associated profits under three different remanufacturing strategies. Our results indicate that the assimilation effect reduces the manufac-turer’s motivation to become engaged in remanufacturing. Specifically, there exists a threshold for the intensity of the assimilation effect for the manufacturer to enter remanufacturing. First, when the assimilation effect is below the threshold, the manufacturer should choose to remanufacture. Otherwise, the manufacturer should only produce new products. Second, the value of the threshold for the assimilation effect is further determined by the remanufacturing’s emission advantage and the carbon trading price. In addition, when the intensity of the assimilation effect is high enough, the carbon trading price and carbon emission advantage no longer impacts the remanufacturing strategy. Lastly, our numerical examples reveal that ignoring the assimilation effect can lead to up to 56.2% loss of potential profit for the manufacturer. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - The human food supply chain is significantly influenced by growing items (GIs) like beef, sheep, hog, chicken, turkey, and other species, as these provide major contributions to food security worldwide. Industrial farming businesses carry out their operations by purchasing a certain species of baby GIs from a supplier, feeding and caring for them until they reach an acceptable living weight, and then selling them after they have been slaughtered and processed. In addition, the production of livestock worldwide accounts for 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), making it a substantial contributor to GHG emissions. Thereby, to regulate emissions, governments from several countries have imposed a tax scheme on the farm's emission volume. Due to the discrete nature of purchase numbers, using a differentiation-based optimization approach is not appropriate for determining the optimal GI procurement for an industrial farm, making the decision significantly more challenging. The primary goal of this study is to identify the optimal number of GIs for a farm to enhance financial and environmental performance when the cost per weight unit of procurement depends on the volume of purchases and the consumption of processed commodities follows a power demand pattern. A comparison tactic is employed only for the discrete decision variable, while the classical optimization tactic, based on differentiation, is adopted for the remaining continuous decision variable of the derived problem. Our method, which is quite straightforward in its operation, enables the creation of a rule to distinguish between instances in which there is only one optimum solution and those in which there are two. The results from the execution of the novel solution technique reveal that the farm reduces the overall cost of the order while keeping the integrality of the purchased GIs by taking into account the regulation for carbon emissions, the discount, and the power demand pattern. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In the low-carbon supply chain (LSC) network, because of the different carbon emission reduction investment costs and product exhibition costs, members of the same level will show certain competitive behavior. This paper aims to realize the low-carbon development of the supply chain network based on the carbon quota trading system and the risk aversion characteristics of retailers and uses variational inequality theory to construct the network equilibrium model under the constraint of inventory capacity, and designs an improved projection contraction algorithm to solve the model. The results mean that when the retailer is risk averse, the improvement of the risk aversion coefficient (RAC) reduces the manufacturer's carbon emission rate and profit and increases the product sales price and retailer's profit. When the retailer has an inventory capacity constraint, the enhancement of the inventory capacity constraint increases the profit of the manufacturer and the retailer but reduces the emission reduction rate of the manufacturer. If the retailer has risk aversion characteristics and inventory capacity constraints, the manufacturers' profits will increase as RAC increases, while retailers' profits will decrease as RAC increases. In addition, the carbon trading mechanism can promote enterprises to invest in carbon emission reduction and raise the low-carbon level of products. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Policymakers face the challenge of integrating intermittent output from variable renewable energy (VRE). Even in a well-functioning power sector with flexible generation, producers’ incentives may not align with society's welfare-maximisation objective. At the same time, political pressure can obstruct policymakers from pricing damage from CO2 emissions according to its social costs. In facilitating decarbonisation, transmission planning will have to adapt to such economic and environmental distortions. Using a Stackelberg model of the Nordic power sector, we find that a first-best transmission-expansion plan involves better resource sharing between zones, which actually reduces the need for some VRE adoption. Next, we allow for departures from perfect competition and identify an extended transmission-expansion plan under market power by nuclear plants. By contrast, temporal arbitrage by hydro reservoirs does not necessitate transmission expansion beyond that of perfect competition because it incentivises sufficient VRE adoption using existing lines. Meanwhile, incomplete CO2 pricing under perfect competition requires a transmission plan that matches hydro-rich zones with sites for VRE adoption. However, since incomplete CO2 pricing leaves fossil-fuelled generation economically viable, it reduces the leverage of strategic producers, thereby catalysing less (more) extensive transmission expansion under market power by nuclear (hydro) plants. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Industrial integrated energy systems (IESs) and electric vehicles (EVs) provide new solutions for addressing the increasing challenges of the energy crisis and environmental pollution. With the increasing number of EVs and smart charging stations in industrial IES, the uncoordinated charging load of EVs imposes significant pressure on IES. Therefore, a well-designed dispatch scheme is crucial for reducing the economic cost for both parties, alleviating the energy supply pressure on IES, and promoting the development of a low-carbon society. To this end, given the load characteristics of EVs in industrial IES, we propose a dispatch framework based on the Stackelberg game theory, which includes the leader and the follower. The leader IES is responsible for formulating both unit dispatch and demand response plans, as well as determining the charging pricing for the smart charging station. The follower smart charging station optimizes EVs charging power by minimizing the charging cost in order to protect the interest of EV owners. Additionally, we introduce the carbon emission flow model into charging station pricing to shift the responsibility for carbon emissions from the generation side to the EV load side. Considering that the two-layer game model is difficult to solve, we use the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker condition and duality theorem to transform it into an equivalent single-layer optimization problem, which is easily solved. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed game framework effectively reduces the economic cost of IES and the charging cost of EVs, alleviates the pressure from charging load, and reduces the carbon emissions of industrial IES. © 2024 Author(s).

AB  - Controlling bioenergy-induced land-use-change emissions is key to exploiting bioenergy for climate change mitigation. However, the effect of different land-use and energy sector policies on specific bioenergy emissions has not been studied so far. Using the global integrated assessment model REMIND-MAgPIE, we derive a biofuel emission factor (EF) for different policy frameworks. We find that a uniform price on emissions from both sectors keeps biofuel emissions at 12 kg CO2 GJ−1. However, without land-use regulation, the EF increases substantially (64 kg CO2 GJ−1 over 80 years, 92 kg CO2 GJ−1 over 30 years). We also find that comprehensive coverage (>90%) of carbon-rich land areas worldwide is key to containing land-use emissions. Pricing emissions indirectly on the level of bioenergy consumption reduces total emissions by cutting bioenergy demand but fails to reduce the average EF. In the absence of comprehensive and timely land-use regulation, bioenergy thus may contribute less to climate change mitigation than assumed previously. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - The transition towards a low-carbon economy is crucial to achieve the Paris climate goals, but it also presents the risk of stranded assets across various industries. However, existing research has mainly focused on upstream and power sectors, leaving the stranded asset risk of individual assets less understood. This study proposes a real options-based framework for evaluating the stranding risk of carbon-intensive assets. To illustrate its practical application, we apply the framework to a fossil-fuel-powered bulk carrier. The results show that under carbon pricing, the shipowner should expect to bear approximately US$26.5 million of stranded asset risk, which would decrease to US$25.2 million if the ship reduces speed to comply with carbon intensity regulations. We conclude that our framework will enable an adequate assessment of these risks, leading to more practical implications for investment decision-making and supporting climate risk management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Finland introduced the planet's first carbon tax in 1990 to experiment with, to most economists, the best policy to reverse carbon emissions. I estimate the causal effect of taxing carbon on Finnish emissions using the Synthetic Control Approach (Abadie, 2021). The results suggest that taxing carbon reduces emissions by big margins. Finnish emissions are 16% lower in 1995, 25% lower in 2000, and 30% lower in 2004 than emissions in the counterfactual consistent with carbon taxes whose value increasing by 20 fold in 1990–2005. The estimates suggest that the carbon tax's abatement elasticity is about 9%. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The G20 nations collectively accounted for a significant portion of global CO2 emissions due to their vast economies and rising energy demand. While some G20 nations have made substantial efforts to reduce their emissions through policies such as renewable energy incentives and carbon pricing, others may still heavily rely on fossil fuels for energy production and industrial processes. Therefore, this recent study endeavoured to investigate the relationship between nuclear energy consumption (NEC), crude oil (CO), and economic policy uncertainty (EPU) with CO2 emissions in three economic sectors of G20 nations. Despite voluminous research work conducted on mitigating CO2 emission, to the best of our understanding, this paper marks the inaugural endeavour to investigate the impact of the afore-mentioned variables in a three-sector model with emission across G20 countries. To achieve this objective, we carried out a range of examinations, encompassing panel unit root and cointegration tests, followed by panel DOLS, ARDL, and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality test, spanning the period from 1990 to 2022. The findings trace that agricultural growth reduces CO2 emissions, while manufacturing and service sector growth increases CO2 emissions in both the short and long run. The panel ARDL analysis shows that CO leads to an increase in carbon emissions in the short term, whereas NEC contributes to a reduction in emissions. In terms of the synergy between NEC and EPU, it is noteworthy to mention that the collective impact of increase in NEC and decrease in EPU reduces the emission in three sectors. Nevertheless, in the long term, EPU exhibits a negative correlation with emissions across three sectors. Hence, the current research proposes waning EPU as a deliberate strategy to reduce emissions under careful consideration of its potential effects and feasibility within broader economic and policy contexts. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.

AB  - This paper introduces an analytical model that characterizes the incentives of the manufacturing industry, consumers, and waste management sectors in closing the material loop. To address identified market failures, various policy instruments are evaluated both theoretically and numerically, using the example of the EU PET market. The assessment shows that a policy package consisting of carbon pricing, advanced disposal fees, and product standards substantially reduces total material consumption and enhances material recovery, leading to a notable reduction in emissions. The analysis of material cost savings, surplus allocation, and social welfare also shows the advantages of such a policy package compared to individual policy instruments. © 2024 The Authors

This study aims to explore the potential synergies between variable renewable energy (VRE), including wind and solar power, and the city-scale operation of battery swapping stations (BSSs) under varying levels of VRE penetration. To this end, an integrated modeling framework that combines multisource traffic data with node-based BSS deployment optimization and hourly power system dispatch simulations was developed. Beijing in 2025 was selected as the case study due to its ambitious EV development goals and the substantial need for VRE integration. The simulation results reveal that system-optimized BSS operations, particularly through bidirectional charging (V2G), can significantly enhance VRE integration, reduce net load fluctuations, and mitigate carbon emissions. Specifically, increasing VRE penetration from 30 % to 70 % reduces VRE curtailment by 1.1 TWh to 6.4 TWh and avoids 3.0 t to 6.3 t of carbon emissions per vehicle annually. The economic analysis further indicates that while current time-of-use electricity pricing leads to higher costs for BSS operations, a real-time pricing mechanism offers a more economically viable solution, benefiting both power system operators and BSS operators. The integrated modeling framework developed in this study not only advances the understanding of city-scale BSS operations but also provides a valuable tool for analyzing the complex interactions between EV infrastructure, VRE integration, and urban power grids. © 2024

AB  - The development of data science and sensing technologies provides opportunities to mitigate uncertainty in hybrid manufacturing–remanufacturing systems, and drives manufacturers to invest in intelligent manufacturing (IM). This paper considers the adoption of IM to mitigate classification errors in the end-of-use (EoU) products’ acquisition while improving the operational efficiency of manufacturing–remanufacturing systems. By constructing game models, we jointly investigate the investment, pricing, production and order quantities, and collection decisions in a closed-loop supply chain. Interestingly, we find that IM does not always increase manufacturers’ enthusiasm to engage in remanufacturing, firms’ profits or consumer surplus. It does not always reduce environmental impact either. Analytical results show that IM reduces manufacturers’ enthusiasm to engage in remanufacturing if the initial core misclassification rate is low. Furthermore, we identify key factors that impact the firms’ profits, consumer surplus, and carbon emissions. For a manufacturer producing high-cost new products, investing in IM hurts its profits when the remanufacturing cost savings due to intelligent manufacturing is small and the manufacturing benefit due to IM is not significant. Moreover, investing in IM reduces consumer surplus if the cost of new products is high, and the IM does not lead to significant remanufacturing cost saving and manufacturing benefit increase. The results reveal that investing in IM is preferred from the environmental point of view if the IM-induced manufacturing cost saving is small. Our research provides management insights into the intelligent transformation of manufacturers with hybrid manufacturing–remanufacturing systems, as well as policymakers concerned with value creation for customers and environmental impacts. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Asia has been experiencing much faster economic growth than the world average and has been consuming more energy and natural resources than our planet’s regenerative capacity can provide. With each passing day, Asia’s carbon emissions have been growing, as does its vulnerability to climate risks. The poor are the most vulnerable to these disruptions, lacking options to adapt to changing climatic conditions. The transition to a low-carbon green growth in almost all of emerging economies in the Asian region is underway. This transition has become unstoppable and irreversible. In this context, it is important to realize that the Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic has its own impact on the economies. Nevertheless, it has also created new once-in-a-generation opportunities for implementing hard policy reforms through economic recovery and stimulus packages. The need to accelerate the low-carbon transition as part of the pandemic recovery is unquestionable, but the question is how to do it in a cost-effective way. This research presents a broad diagnosis of new regional cooperation opportunities in areas essential to complete the transition to a low-carbon economy by 2030 and a net zero economy by 2050–2060. It highlights where regional cooperation and coordination can have the greatest impact. It points to a number of policy areas—trade, carbon taxation, carbon pricing, and innovation—where regional cooperation reduces the cost of implementing national actions and complements global pacts. This model also creates business opportunities for developing competitive green industries and low-carbon technologies across countries in the region. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - To mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the shipping industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which measures CO2 emissions per unit of cargo-carrying capacity and distance traveled. While the implementation of energy-efficient technologies is crucial for meeting CII regulations, these advancements often entail substantial investment costs. Consequently, optimizing operations has become a more practical short-term approach; however, operational adjustments made solely to comply with CII regulations may also have unintended adverse effects. To address this issue, this research develops a pick up and delivery optimization model for tramp ships, which operate on irregular schedules and routes, to minimize total emissions and costs while complying with CII regulations. The model investigates the combination of cargo selection, route planning, and speed optimization, reflecting the comprehensive and unique characteristics of tramp shipping. The problem is solved using Danzig-Wolfe decomposition and a branch-and-price algorithm, with the CII regulations being met in the pricing problem through a customized heuristic. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach can find optimal or near-optimal solutions within a short time. Various experiments explore the effects of CII regulations on tramp shipping operations, environmental performances, and economic benefits. The results indicate that demand-based CII and stricter CII regulations cause ships to carry fewer cargoes, sail shorter ballast distances, reduce speed, and increase load on board. This ultimately reduces CO2 emissions but also lowers total profits. The findings assist industry stakeholders in complying with stringent environmental regulations and aid policymakers in designing targeted regulatory policies, thereby promoting sustainable maritime transport. © 2024

AB  - Revenue recycling is crucial for carbon pricing to achieve inclusive decarbonization and energy transition. Several studies have documented carbon pricing recycling, but few focused on mixed recycling schemes that allocate revenues across multiple institutions. To fill this knowledge gap, we employ a newly developed recursive computable general equilibrium model to explore the socioeconomic consequences of various recycling schemes in the context of China. We find that: (1) Although carbon pricing promotes renewable energy, it adversely affects social welfare and urban–rural equality. When executing the recycling scheme, this negative effect is alleviated. (2) All single recycling scenarios fail to yield a double dividend. They remain detrimental to social welfare and urban–rural equality. (3) Despite small welfare loss, a moderate-share renewables-based mixed recycling scheme reduces urban–rural inequality while favoring decarbonization and energy transition. Our study calls for incorporating mixed recycling options into the policy toolbox in advancing carbon pricing. © 2023

AB  - The traditional centralized optimization method encounters challenges in representing the interaction among multi-agents and cannot consider the interests of each agent. In traditional low-carbon scheduling, the fixed carbon quota trading price can easily cause arbitrage behavior of the trading subject, and the carbon reduction effect is poor. This paper proposes a two-layer dynamic community integrated energy system (CIES) low-carbon collaborative optimization operation method. Firstly, a multi-agent stage feedback carbon trading model is proposed, which calculates carbon trading costs in stages and introduces feedback factors to reduce carbon emissions indirectly. Secondly, a two-layer CIES low-carbon optimal scheduling model is constructed. The upper energy seller (ES) sets energy prices. The lower layer is the combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) system and load aggregator (LA), which is responsible for energy output and consumption. The energy supply and consumption are determined according to the ES energy price strategy, which reversely affects the energy quotation. Then, the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm embedded with quadratic programming is utilized to solve the established scheduling model, which reduces the difficulty and improves the solving efficiency. Finally, the simulation results under the actual CIES example show that compared with the traditional centralized scheduling method, the total carbon emission of the proposed method is reduced by 16.34%, which can improve the income of each subject and make the energy supply lower carbon economy. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - China has to deal with the twin challenges of economic structural reform and carbon emission reduction against global warming. While investing in and constructing new infrastructure is great for the economy, it has also added to the carbon emissions of major cities. The product design industry has recently become increasingly interested in creating and pricing cultural and creative goods in specific provinces. Thanks to the burgeoning global cultural and creative sector, a new platform has opened up for the evolution and modernization of China’s ancient cultural practices. Cultural creativity has broken the rigid design and production pattern of traditional products from a business point of view, increasing their economic advantages and competition. Also, this study examines ICT’s main and moderate effect on carbon emissions in the 27 provinces of China’s economy from 2003 to 2019 using panel estimators. The estimated outcomes show the positive contribution to environmental damages by physical capital, tourism, cultural product prices, innovative, creative prices, and trade openness, while ICT significantly reduces emissions. Besides the moderate role of the digital economy on physical capital, tourism, CP, ICP, and tourism significantly reduce CO2 emissions. However, the granger causality outcomes also show a robust analysis. Furthermore, this study also proposes some interesting policies to obtain environmental sustainability. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - To address the power supply-demand imbalance caused by the uncertainty in wind turbine and photovoltaic power generation in the regional integrated energy system, this study proposes a bi-level optimization strategy that considers the uncertainties in photovoltaic and wind turbine power generation as well as demand response. The upper-level model analyzes these uncertainties by modeling short-term and long-term output errors using robust optimization theory, applies an improved stepwise carbon trading model to control carbon emissions, and finally constructs an electricity-hydrogen-carbon cooperative scheduling optimization model to reduce wind and carbon emissions. The lower-level model incentivizes users to participate in integrated demand response through dynamic energy pricing, thereby reducing the annual consumption cost of load aggregator. The Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions and the Big-M method are used to solve the bi-level optimization model. Simulation results indicate that the improved carbon trading model reduces carbon emissions by approximately 40.12 tons per year, a decrease of 1.1%; the prediction accuracy of the short-term error model improves by 6.77%, and the prediction accuracy of the long-term error model improves by 15.16%; the electricity-hydrogen-carbon synergistic dispatch optimization model enhances the total profit of integrated energy system operator by 14.07% and reduces the total cost of load aggregator by 10.06%. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This contribution introduces a novel carbon pricing system and illustrates its benefits. The system is based on two related but distinct ideas. First, we group the global pools of carbon into three aggregate pools, and we tax or credit human-caused carbon fluxes across the boundaries of the pools. Second, we base the tax or credit solely on physical movements of carbon between pools; hence, the system uses a physical baseline instead of a behavioral baseline based on the hypothetical emissions levels that would have arisen absent the carbon price. The proposed system goes beyond the limitations of current carbon pricing schemes for a number of reasons: it is designed to capture all positive and negative emissions based purely on their climate impact, allowing a broader scope and more appropriate incentives than current systems; it avoids creating bad incentives, particularly those caused by additionality requirements found in carbon offset systems; it captures the complexity of carbon movements through human and natural systems; it reduces measurement errors; and it provides transparent and easily observed price signals. Though this manuscript is conceptual in nature and refrains from discussing the technicalities related to the implementation of the proposed carbon pricing system, we trust that it may contribute to the development of policies enabling a net-zero and net-negative CO2-emissions world. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines the optimal energy mix for industrial complexes by incorporating renewable energy systems, decarbonization strategies, and sector coupling technologies. Using data from the Balan Industrial Complex in Korea, five energy scenarios were evaluated, ranging from conventional systems (Scenario 1) to advanced renewable configurations (Scenario 5). The results show that Scenario 5, which integrates sector coupling systems and decarbonization technologies, is the most cost-effective and environmentally sustainable. Scenario 5 achieves the lowest Net Present Cost (NPC), and significantly reduces CO2 emissions. Furthermore, an analysis of electricity prices and CO2 costs from Korea, the United States, and Germany highlights the critical role of regional electricity tariffs and carbon pricing in determining the economic feasibility of energy systems. While renewable setups require higher initial investments, Scenario 5 proves to be the most economically viable over time, offering both cost savings and environmental benefits. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and industry leaders, emphasizing the importance of customized strategies to optimize energy systems in industrial applications. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - This paper applies an energy systems model to evaluate how shared mobility (ride-hailing and shared autonomous vehicles), public buses, alternative energy sources (electricity and biofuels) and carbon pricing contribute to reduce passenger vehicles CO2 emissions in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, from 2016 to 2050. Public buses and carpooled shared mobility increase system capacity, resulting in lower vehicle ownership, energy demand and CO2 emissions, as well as savings per ton of CO2 abated (from $3 to $4186). Biofuels reduce CO2 emissions at no increased system cost, while carbon pricing is the most effective policy to reduce CO2 emissions, but it is costlier than the alternatives and results in greater private vehicle use (up to 260%) if the expansion of zero-carbon public transportation remains limited due to technology adoption. The policy that reduces the most emissions (by 84%) combines the expansion of renewable electricity generation and implementation of a CO2 price. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Climate change and increased greenhouse gas emissions boost the global average temperature to less than 2°C, which is the estimated breakeven point. The globe is moving into blue pollution economies as the environmental sustainability objective becomes more distorted. The study looked at three United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, namely (i) affordable and clean energy; (ii) industry, innovation, and infrastructure; and (iii) climate change, to see how far the Chinese economy has progressed toward green and clean development strategy. In the context of China, the “pollution damage function” was intended to refer to carbon damages related to carbon pricing, technological variables, sustained economic growth, incoming foreign investment, and green energy. The data was collected between 1975 and 2019 and analyzed using various statistical approaches. The results of the autoregressive distributed lag model suggest that carbon taxes on industrial emissions reduce carbon damages in the short and long run. Furthermore, a rise in inbound foreign investment and renewable energy demand reduces carbon damages in the short term, proving the “pollution halo” and “green energy” hypotheses; nonetheless, the results are insufficient to explain the stated results in the long run. In the long run, technology transfers and continued economic growth are beneficial in reducing carbon damages and confirming the potential of cleaner solutions in pollution mitigation. The causal inferences show the one-way relationship running from carbon pricing and technology transfer to carbon damages, and green energy to high-technology exports in a country. The impulse response estimates suggested that carbon tax, inbound foreign investment, and technology transfers likely decrease carbon damages for the next 10 years. On the other hand, continued economic growth and inadequate green energy sources are likely to increase carbon pollution in a country. The variance decomposition analysis suggested that carbon pricing and information and communication technology exports would likely significantly influence carbon damages over time. To keep the earth’s temperature within the set threshold, the true motivation to shift from a blue to a green economy required strict environmental legislation, the use of green energy sources, and the export of cleaner technologies.

AB  - Addressing the conflict between fossil fuel exploitation, usage, and greenhouse gas emissions is a top priority for China’s low-carbon socioeconomic development. Scalable Axisymmetric Matrix “a computerized general equilibrium model” is used to assess the impact of carbon tax policies on energy usage, carbon pollution, and macroeconomic drivers at reduction levels of 10%, 20%, and 30% of emissions. In the meantime, we examine the impact of various carbon tax recycling schemes in line with the tax neutrality concept. Although the carbon tax successfully reduces carbon emissions, we conclude that it will have a detrimental effect on the economy and social well-being. To cope with China’s increasing pollution emissions and ecological imbalances, the Chinese government promulgated the environmental protection tax law of the people’s Republic of China, which was officially implemented in 2018. Although carbon dioxide is not included in the Taxable Pollutants and Single Quantity Table attached to this law, China has almost reached a consensus on taxing carbon emissions. In 2021, the State Council of China issued the opinions on completely, accurately, and comprehensively implementing the new development concept and doing a good job in carbon peak and carbon neutralization, which made a comprehensive deployment to achieve the “double carbon” goal and improved the carbon tax policy and legal system, which is an essential part of it. Therefore, based on fiscal neutrality, an effective carbon tax recycling scheme can mitigate the adverse effects of its adoption. However, due to the current development in China’s energy-generating and transportation sectors, even minor steps can have huge effects on emissions with marginal economic implications.

AB  - Herein we study carbon taxation considering the structure of the global production network. With this purpose we characterize how the implementation of a carbon tax in one country-sector can generate sizeable fluctuations on global emissions and welfare through its impact on the structure of production. We then apply this theoretical characterization to accommodate the structure of a multi-regional input–output database. This framework allows us to identify the country-sectors that should be taxed to reach the strongest potential for emission reduction (or welfare maximization) if no coordinated policy is possible. Interestingly, this choice not only depends on emission intensity but also on to which extent the sector is central in the global production network as well as on the pass-through effect on public or private spending. Additionally, we find that synergies between taxes applied to different country-sectors have a strong impact in emission reductions, calling for greater harmonization in carbon taxation around the world. We then use our model to simulate the impact of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) finding that, when looked into sector by sector, it reduces EU competitiveness loss due to carbon pricing but, when generalized to all EU sectors, the impact through the value chain ends up provoking a stronger contraction in the EU than without the CBAM. © 2024

AB  - Due to exponential growth in transportation sector, our environment is facing a drastic change. The global warming is not only effecting our planet but also indirectly effecting humans and other living creatures. To cater this problem, Electric Vehicles (EVs) were introduced. EVs provide us a greener environment which reduces carbon and greenhouse emissions. But, increased demand of EVs also results in increased demand of power and Charging Stations (CSs). This paper mainly discusses the profit maximization of CSs owners by introducing the photovoltaic source (PV) and battery bank. The control scheme uses an algorithm involving Convex Optimization which ensures that profit of CS is maximized while the issues of grid overloading and load shedding are avoided along with optimized usage of all available resources. The addition of the PV source to the CSs, which helps the CSs owners to increase the profit and provide good rates during the peak hours. Generator is added to enhance user experience and at the same time it helps in avoiding load shedding. This problem also manages the random arrival and departure of the EVs during 24 hours which raises an issue of grid overloading. The simulation results show that the objectives were successfully achieved.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Energy aggregators (EA) play an important role in the electricity- carbon joint market. EA can aggregate traditional thermal power units and renewable energy generators, and their operation strategies will directly affect the renewable energy consumption, carbon emission allowances (CEA) and economic benefits of the system, and their decisions will play a counterproductive role in the pricing of electric energy and CEA. Firstly, based on the renewable portfolio standards, this paper proposed a clearing model of the electricity and carbon market for EA. Secondly, after fully considering the uncertainty of renewable energy, a two-stage optimization model that can maximize the benefits of EA and maximize social welfare is established by simulating the trading process of EA in the electric energy carbon emission rights market. Finally, by using the KKT theorems and dual theory, the initial nonlinear two-stage problem is transformed into a linear mathematical problem with equilibrium constraints. The above model is analyzed on the improved IEEE-30 node power grid model. The results show that the strategic behavior of EA both increases their revenue and effectively reduces the carbon emissions of the system.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - High temperature heat pump is a promising solution for efficient high temperature heat supply. However, the poor performance when it operates in large temperature lift hinders it from utilizing low temperature waste heat. To solve this problem, a cascade high temperature heat pump with economized vapor injection was established and a simulation model was developed accordingly. The tests were conducted using R134a/R245fa and R1234ze(E)/HP-1 at heat source temperature from 5 to 30 °C and heat sink temperature from 90 to 120 °C, with the coefficient of performance (COP) varying in the range of 1.72–2.73 and 1.77–2.75, respectively. The COP about 2.20 was achieved with R1234ze(E)/HP-1 at optimal intermediate temperature and optimal economized vapor injection pressure when the temperature lift is 100 °C. In the simulated case study, the heat pump water boiler based on the experimental prototype decreases CO2 emission by 62.8 % compared to electric boiler. Moreover, using low GWP working fluids reduces 1.32 × 104 kg direct CO2 emission in TEWI. Under the current technological, pricing, and operational condition, it takes 16 years for heat pump to have economic benefit over electric boiler, but this duration can be shortened with reduced initial cost, improved COP, and increased operating hours and electricity price. In summary, this work presented a high-efficient, environmentally friendly, and economically viable cascade high temperature heat pump system which has potential to utilize the abundant environmental heat source and deliver high temperature heat, being an alternative to the conventional heat generation equipment such as boilers. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - To address the increasing energy demands in data centers, distributed multi-energy system (DMES) can provide an efficient solution. This study proposes a DMES coupled by photovoltaics, wind turbines, ground source heat pump, internal combustion engines, electric chillers, absorption chillers, and energy storage device. The optimal scheduling of DMES with source-load interaction plays a crucial role in improving the performance of data centers. To achieve this, an integrated demand response (IDR) strategy is established, considering time-of-use pricing and renewable energy peak subsidies. Then, a clean and economical optimal operation model for DMES based on proposed IDR strategy and carbon trading mechanisms is established. Furthermore, to enhance the robustness of scheduling, this study analyzes the impacts of uncertainties in renewable energy output and demand response on DMES operation using the Monte Carlo method and interval method. Case study results demonstrate that the proposed IDR strategy increases electricity and cooling loads while reducing heat loads during the peak period of renewable energy generation, compared to the traditional IDR strategy. The proposed scheduling model, which incorporates the proposed IDR strategy and carbon trading mechanism, improves data center performance by reducing total costs by 1.85%, carbon emissions by 0.56%, electricity purchases by 2.93%, while increasing renewable energy utilization by 0.77%. The results also highlight the critical role of energy storage devices, with an optimal initial charge state is 0.5. Additionally, optimization considering multiple uncertainties, results in higher total costs and broader interval widths compared to single-factor uncertainty optimization, but reduces system operational risk. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigates a sustainable three-echelon supply chain structure (supplier–retailer–customer) from the retailer's perspective for a perishable product where: (1) the retailer pays the purchase cost to the supplier in the form of an advance-cash-credit (ACC) payment while granting their customers a partial credit, (2) the supplier offers a price discount to the retailer to facilitate sales, (3) the deterioration rate of items increases over time due to an expiration date, (4) the customer is allowed a partial delay in orders with a fixed market tolerance period, and (5) the supply chain management (SCM) structure takes consideration of government cap-and-trade regulation. This paper intends to establish the retailer's optimum cycle time, selling price, and inventory period simultaneously to maximize his/her total profit. An efficient algorithm has been constructed to find optimal solutions. Two examples have been presented to validate the proposed model. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the four different payment methods (upstream ACC, advance, cash, credit, and downstream partial credit payments) has been carried out and sensitivity analyses have been performed to gain managerial insights. Our numerical results reveal that with the increase in the discount rate, the selling price reduces significantly, however, the retailer's profit increases tremendously. The reason for this phenomenon is that a higher discount rate can lead to a higher profit for the retailer, hence, the retailer may set a lower price to increase sales. Many retailers desire a high discount rate, which is associated with the upstream advance and downstream partial credit payment; however, the computational results show that this payment method causes significant damage to the environment. Hence, two payment methods (upstream ACC, credit, and downstream partial credit payments) are recommended. The reason is that these two payment types bring more profits to the retailer and result in less damage to the environment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Machine learning provides a powerful mechanism to enhance the capabilities of the next generation of smart cities. Whether healthcare monitoring, building automation, energy management, or traffic management, use cases of capability enhancement using machine learning have been significant in recent years. This paper proposes a modeling approach for scheduling energy consumption within smart homes based on a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA). Distributed energy management plays a significant role in reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions as compared to centralized energy generation. Multiple energy consumers can schedule energy-consuming household tasks using home energy management systems in coordination to reduce economic costs and greenhouse gas emissions. In this work, such a home energy management system is used to collect energy price data from the electricity company via an embedded device-enabled smart meter and schedule energy consumption tasks based on this data. We schedule daily power consumption tasks using a multiobjective optimization method that considers environmental and economic sustainability. Two conflicting objectives are minimizing daily energy costs and reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Based on electricity tariffs, CO2 intensity, and the window of time during which electricity is consumed, energy consumption tasks involving distributed energy resources (DERs) and electricity consumption are scheduled. The proposed model is implemented in a model smart building consisting of 30 homes under 3 pricing schemes. The energy demand is spread out across a 24-hour period for points A2–A4 under CPP-PDC, which produces a more flattened curve than point A1. There are competing goals between electricity costs and carbon footprints at points B2–B4 under the CPP-PDC, where electricity demand is set between 20:00 and 0:00. Power grids’ peak energy demand is comparatively low when scheduling under CPP-PDC for points A5 and B5. Reducing carbon emissions, CPP-PDC reduces the maximum demand for electricity from the grid and the overall demand above the predetermined level. The maximum power demand from the grid is minimized for points A5 and B5, reducing up to 22% compared to A2. The proposed method minimizes both energy costs as well as CO2 emissions. A Pareto curve illustrates the trade-off between cost and CO2 emissions. Ó The Author(s), published by EDP Sciences, 2024.

AB  - Energy management is an important mean for the integrated energy system (IES) to realize efficient energy utilization and low-carbon economic operation, and the proper pricing strategy of energy service provider (ESP) and energy consumption strategies of users are important factors in realizing efficient energy management of electric-thermal IES. This paper proposes a two-stage energy management method for IES considering the energy pre-transaction behavior of ESP and users. First, an energy interaction framework of the IES is proposed with the agents of the ESP and users. Subsequently, a two-stage energy management method that considers the pre-transaction behavior and operation optimization of the IES is established. In the first stage, the energy pre-transaction behavior model between ESP and users is studied, where the energy pre-transaction behavior is formulated as a discrete finite Markov decision process (MDP) to obtain the maximum price of ESP and the maximum adjustment load of users. In the second stage, considering the constraints of the energy price and load adjustment in the first stage, an energy interaction game model based on Stackelberg is established to obtain the optimal price and energy management strategy. Finally, the numerical results show that the proposed two-stage energy management method improves the profitability of ESP and users, promotes the utilization ratio of renewable energy and reduces the carbon emissions of the system. The numerical results show that the proposed method can significantly promote the profit of ESP by 58.47% and comprehensive benefit of users by 5.72%. In addition, the proposed method is also effective in improving the utilization of renewable energy and reducing carbon emissions, and the carbon emission of IES reduced 4.61% compared with traditional method. © 2023

AB  - In the context of the steady development of modern power systems, short-term load forecasting is crucial to the planning and operation of the power grid. Traditional load forecasting methods are effective for linear problems, but often do not work well when dealing with highly fluctuating or nonlinear loads. Therefore, this paper adopts a POA-TCN-BiLSTM model for short-term power load forecasting. The Pelican Optimization Algorithm (POA) adjusts the periodic components of the data to reduce noise interference. Temporal convolutional network (TCN) effectively captures the local features of load data through convolution, while bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM) exploits its bidirectional structure to extract long-term dependencies in time series data. In addition, the application of demand response (DR) in power systems is also explored. By dynamically responding to time-of-use electricity prices, we optimize grid operations and reduce energy costs and carbon emissions. The results show that the accuracy of this algorithm is more outstanding compared with other models. This method adjusts the power load according to changes in electricity prices, effectively reduces electricity consumption during periods of high electricity prices and increases electricity consumption during periods of low electricity prices, ensuring economic operation and enhancing grid stability. This research provides an efficient and economical method for power system load forecasting and dispatching.  © 2024 IEEE.

AB  - This paper considers a manufacturer selling his products with the marketplace or the reselling mode under the cap-and-trade regulation. Coupons are allocated when selling the products. We explore the optimal decisions, the selection and the coordination with the two modes. First, we analytically find that the increase of the cap and platform power (commission rate) increases (decreases) the total production quantity and the optimal production quantity for coupon-sensitive consumers, and interestingly find that it reduces (increases) the production quantity for coupon-insensitive consumers when the sensitivity of the coupons is high. Furthermore, the optimal profit of the manufacturer first increases and then decreases with the cap when the emission intensity is low, and it increases with the cap when the emission intensity is high. Second, the marketplace mode creates more (less) profits for the manufacturer if the order-fulfillment cost is low (high). Whether the marketplace mode or the reselling mode will generate more carbon emission depends on the commission rate and the platform power. Finally, the marketplace mode is not capable of coordinating the manufacturer and the platform at all times, while the reselling mode can coordinate the two firms after considering a coupon-sharing contract under considerable platform power, and they can achieve Pareto improvement with a two-part tariff contract under the generalized Nash bargaining framework. © 2022 The Authors.

AB  - The increasing penetration of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) brings both opportunities and challenges to the power grid. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) proposes a promising solution that enhances grid resilience, reduces carbon emissions and saves facility investment. However, the actual motivation of drivers to participate in such programs is questionable: they may have to unexpectedly depart earlier than anticipated, thus risking that their vehicles are not adequately charged. As a consequence, they may refuse to accept the flexible charging plan even though it is attractive in the explicit cost. In this work, we formulate a bi-level model where EV charging station (EVCS) and drivers are considered as distinct entities, both having their own utility functions to maximize. We make extensive discussion on the stochasticity in actual cost of a session, including the energy cost and potential dissatisfaction, of choosing different charging modes. We challenging the widely-adopted assumption that all customers are risk-neutral, and characterize the behavioral differences among different customers with varying time value ν and risk preference factor ρ. Accordingly, we propose a novel pricing/service scheme, denoted asdouble commitment (DC) to alleviate customers’ concerns on energy short when engaging V2G. The name of the scheme suggests that besides the single commitment (SC) on full charge by stated departure, it also allows users to specify a safety window within which EV charge for basic mobility is ensured. We demonstrate that by introducing double commitment, 15% more customers change their charging modes from ASAP to FLEX/V2G. As a consequence, EVCS gains flexibility to save energy costs, which is mainly realized from a reduction of demand charge. Hence, it also helps enhance grid reliablity and stability. © 2023 IBPSA.All rights reserved.

AB  - The energy, utilities, industrial, and material sectors are crucial suppliers of essential goods and services, but their business operations are among the largest sources of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, companies in these sectors play a pivotal role in the low-carbon transition and face substantial stakeholder pressure to manage their transition risks and reduce their environmental impact. Here, we argue that effective responses to transition challenges require diversifying investments in adaptation and mitigation initiatives across a broad range of activities and goals. Analysing financial and nonfinancial data from a global sample of publicly traded companies, we find that those who extensively diversify their investments are better able to reduce their emissions over time. Diversification also reduces carbon pricing risk, thereby lowering exposure to transition risks, under several climate policy scenarios. Our findings provide empirical evidence that business leaders in critical sectors for the low-carbon transition should incorporate well-diversified investments in adaptation and mitigation initiatives into their sustainability strategies to manage interconnected transition challenges. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - We investigated whether carbon taxes with and without carbon dividends improve cooperative behavior to mitigate simulated climate change. We implemented a randomized controlled trial on a large sample of the U.S. general population (N=2,116). Played in real-time in groups of four, we tested three carbon-pricing treatments and a baseline condition within a modified threshold public goods game of loss avoidance. We found that a carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends reduces carbon-emitting group consumption relative to a baseline condition with no tax, and relative to a carbon tax only. A carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends paid out to below-average polluters (asymmetric dividend) worked best, with 94% of groups remaining below a critical consumption (emission) threshold. We also found that experiencing the asymmetric dividend condition positively affected perceptions of carbon pricing with carbon dividends. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Whether technological progress can provide a complementary solution that reduces the economic costs of carbon pricing policies, thereby accomplishing a win-win situation for carbon abatement and economic growth? By developing an improved multi-regional dynamic CGE model that integrates investment adjustment costs into the capital accumulation equation, this study provides a lens through which to evaluate the collective impacts of the national carbon market, carbon tax, and technology progress in China. The findings confirm the substantial potential of carbon pricing policies to curtail CO (Formula presented.) emissions, highlighting their critical role in climate change mitigation. Yet, it also exposes a trade-off, where these policies might impact GDP growth and exports, necessitating a balanced approach to policy design. The outputs of energy sectors are particularly vulnerable to carbon pricing policies, indicating a need for tailored strategies to support these industries in their transition towards sustainability. The study uncovers that the fusion of carbon pricing policies with technological progress can enhance carbon abatement efforts while softening the economic blow, illuminating a path to sustainable development that balances environmental and economic imperatives. © 2024 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The transition to electric mobility reduces transportation carbon emissions but presents challenges in integrating growing electricity demand with renewable electricity generation and power systems. Smart charging emerges as a key technology to minimize operational costs and support higher utilization of green electricity for electric vehicles (EVs). Market analysis indicates a trend towards dynamic electricity tariffs, incentivizing EV charging at times favourable to the electricity grid, yet existing literature fails to address smart charging technology in sync with times of lower electricity prices and higher renewables integration. This work examines different smart charging strategies for a commercial EV fleet in Germany, considering a Real-Time Pricing (RTP) tariff indexed to day-ahead market prices and renewable electricity integrations. HOMER Grid is used to model these smart charging strategies and generate new EV load profiles. Direct and indirect CO2 emissions and renewable electricity usage ratios are calculated based on detailed electricity grid and self consumption data. The resulting Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) is minimized, by adjusting solar PV and battery capacities. The adoption of an RTP tariff decreases the LCOE from €0.530 to €0.314 per kWh. A smart charging strategy designed to reduce peak demand and schedule charging at lower price times further reduces the LCOE to €0.283 per kWh. The lowest LCOE of €0.281 per kWh is achieved with 34.4 kWp of solar PV capacity and no batteries. The carbon impact is minimized with larger solar PV and battery capacities. The performed work indicates a favourable framework for EV charging integrators to maximize cost savings and renewable energy integration for an EV fleet charging use case. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In recent years, the crowdsourcing concept has been applied to last mile logistics. This study contributes to this growing field of research by addressing crowdsourcing integration into last mile delivery. To consider crowdsourced delivery options, an individual crowdsourced fleet is characterized in terms of its delivery pricing. A mathematical model is proposed to determine the potential set of locations for terminals for delivery-dedicated and individual crowdsourced fleets, with the objective of minimizing the total last mile delivery cost when demand and delivery pricing change depending on the floating population of a given city. Through numerical experiments with the annual floating population data in Ulsan Metropolitan City in the Republic of Korea, we identify the optimal sets of terminals for the integrated last mile delivery platform consisting of delivery-dedicated and individual crowdsourced fleets. Results show that the proposed model significantly reduces total cost by employing crowd workers in highly populated areas rather than those merely positioned close to the final delivery destinations. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis is conducted regarding three cost parameters that are likely to impact the effectiveness and efficiency of the last mile delivery process. We further analyze the cost and carbon emissions associated with integrating crowdsourcing into the last mile delivery platform as well as the strategic distribution of incentive pay to encourage the shift to electric vehicles for last mile deliveries. Lastly, we investigate the effects of different traffic conditions on the optimal solutions. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Energy storage technologies are vital in improving the operation performance of grid-connected distributed energy systems. The adjustability of indoor temperature and the thermal inertia of buildings can form an excellent virtual energy storage. However, there are few studies on the impact of this virtual energy storage on the operation performance of grid-connected distributed energy systems. Therefore, this study first calculates the equivalent thermal resistance and thermal capacitance of a building by using EnergyPlus and establishes the first-order thermodynamic load calculation model. Subsequently, the system dynamic optimal scheduling model, considering the virtual energy storage, was developed based on the first-order thermodynamic load calculation model. The Gurobi nonconvex solver is used to optimize the model, and the results are compared with the optimal scheduling results without considering the virtual energy storage. The results indicate that, guided by time-of-use electricity pricing, the virtual energy storage effectively reduces the air conditioning load during high and peak tariff periods while increasing it during valley tariff periods. This change in air conditioning load leads to an increase in grid power consumption during valley tariff periods. However, it also improves the system's operation efficiency and ultimately reduces the total grid power and gas consumption. The lower energy consumption makes the primary energy saving rate and carbon dioxide emission reduction rate of Scenario 2 greater than zero compared to Scenario 1 and increases with the increase of renewable energy penetration of the integrated power system. Furthermore, affected by the difference in the proportion of grid power consumption under time-of-use electricity pricing and the total energy consumption, the system's operating cost in Scenario 2 is less than in Scenario 1. The reduction rates in summer and winter typical days are 1.95 % and 6.48 %, respectively. Therefore, fully utilizing the virtual energy storage under air conditioning and building coupling can reduce the operating cost, primary energy consumption, and carbon dioxide emissions of grid-connected distributed energy systems. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electricity pricing can be used to shift the timing of electricity demand, but the choice of price signals is highly constrained. Consumer rates are updated every few years and limited to simple daily profiles, yet must capture the complex dynamics of a changing electricity system. Emission factors (EFs) were developed as an evaluation tool, but are increasingly used as demand response (DR) signals. Given these constraints, can they be effective? We evaluate the emissions impact of EF-based electricity rates with and without supply-side emissions pricing. We study controlled electric vehicle (EV) charging in the Western U.S. up to 2037 by coupling an electricity system dispatch model and a data-driven EV charging model. We compare average and short-run marginal EFs with a new medium-run marginal EF that better matches the timeline of electricity rate updates. We find that a stable supply-side signal makes DR more valuable: DR reduces emissions by up to 6% with supply-side carbon pricing or just 2% without it. Medium-run marginal EFs yield the most consistent emission reductions, but constraints on charging flexibility limit their impact. We recommend policymakers base rates for DR on medium-run marginal emission factors and implement supply-side carbon pricing to facilitate greater emission reductions. © 2024

AB  - How do policymakers manage the tension between enforcing a carbon price and ensuring low-cost electricity provision? This paper answers this question in two steps. First, it combines literature on electricity market design and rent management to arrive at a novel analytical framework. Carbon pricing can disrupt longstanding rent transfers between the state and electricity consumers by making it more expensive to produce and/or consume fossil fuel-based electricity. We theorize that policymakers respond to this dilemma by making incremental policy design adjustments to gradually enforce rent losses across the electricity production value chain. We apply this framework to study the implementation of the Korean emissions trading scheme (ETS) policy 2015–2022. Drawing on 20 expert interviews and policy documents we identify an initial sequence of policy design adjustments which enable, but also delay, the enforcement of the carbon price signal in the electricity system. This incremental and politically contentious process reduces the ETS policy’s ability to abate greenhouse gas emissions from the Korean electricity sector in the short term. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of carbon pricing in the electricity sector hinge on the parallel construction of supportive institutions to permit meaningful carbon cost pass-through. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Reducing animal-based food production would not only reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions but also free land that could sequester carbon. We examine the efficiency of a subsidy to cattle farmers for setting aside land for natural ecosystem regeneration. We develop a partial equilibrium model of the cattle sector that integrates land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and animal feeding. We compare the subsidy to alternative policies: a meat tax and a standard on animal feeding. We identify the conditions under which the subsidy is the best alternative to these other second-best policies. The efficiency of the subsidy lies in its effects on both the extensive margin (reduced quantity of meat) and the intensive margin (production intensification, which reduces both the emission and land-use intensities of meat). An empirical application to France, where spontaneous regeneration corresponds mostly to forest regrowth, shows that the subsidy dominates the other alternative policies considered for a wide range of parameter values but is sensitive to carbon leakage when the economy is open to trade. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - To increase competition, control price, and decrease inefficiency in the carbon allowance auction market, limitations on bidding price and volume can be set. With limitations, participants have the same cap bidding price and volume. While without the limitations, participants have different values per unit of carbon allowance; therefore, some participants may be strong and the other week. Due to the impact of these limitations on the auction, this paper tries to compare the uniform and discriminatory pricing in a carbon allowance auction with and without the limitations utilizing a multi-agent-based model consisting of the government and supply chains. The government determines the supply chains' initial allowances. The supply chains compete in the carbon auction market and determine their bidding strategies based on the Q-learning algorithm. Then they optimize their tactical and operational decisions. They can also trade their carbon allowances in a carbon trading market in which price is free determined according to carbon supply and demand. Results show that without the limitations, the carbon price in the uniform pricing is less than or equal to the discriminatory pricing method. At the same time, there are no differences between them in the case with limitations. Overall, the auction reduces the profit of the supply chains. This negative effect is less in uniform than discriminatory pricing in the case without the limitations. Nevertheless, the strong supply chains make huge profits from the auction when mitigation rate is high. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Sociedade Brasileira de Matemática Aplicada e Computacional.

AB  - This study examines the effects of carbon pricing in Germany, Spain, and the broader European context using the dynamic, three-region environmental multisector general equilibrium model, EMuSe. Our findings indicate that unilateral carbon pricing in Germany or Spain leads to a sustained negative output. The marginal increase in production costs outweighs modest reductions in emissions. However, when Europe collectively adopts carbon pricing, the long-term output effects become positive, although there are more significant transition costs due to close trade relations within Europe. We find evidence of carbon leakage, which is marginally mitigated by a border adjustment mechanism. However, this mechanism mainly protects domestic carbon-intensive sectors and produces inconsistent country outcomes; Germany gains, while Spain loses. Notably, Spain's energy sector emerges as a long-term beneficiary due to its relatively lower emission intensity. The findings highlight the strategic importance for Europe to engage global partners in carbon pricing as it reduces the economic downturn phase and increases long-term gains. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper assesses the impact of the Pilot of Critical Peak Pricing for Industrial Electricity (PCPPIE) on industrial Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by employing the Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology. It is found that the cities participating in PCPPIE underwent a significant 11.3% reduction in the GHGs emitted per industrial enterprise. These findings remain robust across various methodologies, including staggered DID estimators, propensity score matching, instrumental variable methods, and spatial econometric regression. The generalized DID analysis shows that a higher critical peak price corresponds to a more substantial decrease in GHG emissions. PCPPIE achieves weaker GHG reduction in higher-administrative level cities but stronger in those with higher industrial share, and the effectiveness of PCPPIE is compromised by cross-regional electricity imports. PCPPIE reduces GHG emission intensity of the power industry and contributes to additional reductions in GHG emissions from other sources by fostering green technological innovation and facilitating energy substitution. The practical significance of this paper is to reveal a richer dynamic mechanism for China's green and sustainable development, indicating that critical peak pricing is a power pricing strategy worthy of strengthening and optimization in the process of China's carbon peak and carbon neutrality. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study investigates the impact of financial development and foreign direct investment (FDI) on CO2 emissions, with a special focus on carbon pricing (emissions trading and taxing) in 57 developed and developing economies between 2000 and 2017. Using an eight-fold financial development construct for the first time, we find that financial depth in institutions negatively (positively) affects the CO2 intensity of developed (developing) economies, while financial access to institutions has a negative impact in both types of economies. Financial depth (stability) in markets negatively affects developing (developed) economies’ CO2 intensity, while financial access to markets increases (decreases) CO2 intensity in developed (developing) economies. Moreover, inward FDI stock quality (a net FDI position) increases (reduces) CO2 intensity in developing (developed) economies. Finally, we document that carbon pricing in developed economies helps reverse the positive effect of inward FDI quality on CO2 intensity, implying that a such policy helps those economies attract climate-friendly FDI. Our study reveals the implications of the reduction of CO2 emissions placing the focus on both financial development and FDI fully and together for the first time. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - This study evaluates the efficiency and fairness of China’s Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) using a bi-level numerical model. The model comprises a regulatory level that sets the required share of renewables and a market level where electricity producers and consumers respond to these policies. In a perfectly competitive market, carbon pricing is identified as the most efficient policy to promote the development of renewable energy, while the RPS closely approximates an optimal policy tool. By mandating a certain percentage of renewable energy generation, the RPS significantly promotes renewable energy development and substantially reduces emissions. Additionally, RPS improves welfare levels in the central regions, addressing regional welfare disparities. RPS is deemed appropriate, especially considering that China's carbon pricing mechanisms are not yet fully supportive of renewable energy development. © The Authors.

AB  - In the pursuit of a near‑carbon-emission electric sector, concentrated solar power plants (CSP) and wind generators have gained prominence, promising dispatchable electricity for renewable-dominated grids. However, the existing studies focus on the coordinated scheduling of CSP and wind energy, overlooking the critical issue of energy pricing and trading. Moreover, a decentralized model for multiple networks that incorporate both CSP and wind generators, remains under-investigated. Accordingly, this paper proposes a fully decentralized distributionally robust transactive energy management (DRTM) framework for the energy trading, pricing and scheduling across multiple integrated wind-concentrated solar virtual power plants (IWC-VPP), using the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). This model allows each IWC-VPP operator to make independent decisions and share minimal information, ensuring privacy encryption. Based on the distributionally robust optimization (DRO), the DRTM framework can balance robustness and cost-effectiveness in making decisions under uncertainties. For efficient resolution, an adaptive buffer-column and constraint generation (AB-C&CG) algorithm is introduced, which reduces the complexity of the master problem compared to the traditional C&CG. Additionally, a varying penalty factor technique is integrated into ADMM to accelerate computation, and a two-block process is implemented to ensure finite convergence of the entire decentralized framework. Numerical studies on the three-VPP 25-Bus system and four-VPP 156-Bus system validate the effectiveness of the proposed DRTM framework. The simulation results demonstrate the varying penalty factor technique bolsters computational efficiency by up to 46.51% for standard ADMM. Compared with the conventional C&CG, the AB-C&CG significantly reduces the computational consumption by 50.98%, and with the error <0.46%. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The design and conduct of climate change policy necessarily confronts uncertainty along multiple fronts. We explore the consequences of ambiguity over various sources and configurations of models that affect how economic opportunities could be damaged in the future.We appeal to decision theory under risk, model ambiguity, and misspecification concerns to provide an economically motivated approach to uncertainty quantification. We show how this approach reduces the many facets of uncertainty into a lowdimensional characterization that depends on the uncertainty aversion of a decision maker or fictitious social planner. In our computations, we take inventory of three alternative channels of uncertainty and provide a novel way to assess them. These include (i) carbon dynamics that capture how carbon emissions affect atmospheric carbon in future time periods, (ii) temperature dynamics that depict how atmospheric carbon alters temperature in future time periods, and (iii) damage functions that quantify how temperature changes diminish economic opportunities. We appeal to geoscientific modeling to quantify the first two channels. We show how these uncertainty sources interact for a social planner looking to design a prudent approach to the social pricing of carbon emissions. © 2022, University of Chicago Press.

AB  - We investigate the carbon emission reduction efforts and pricing decisions for a two chains system under carbon taxation. In this system, each chain consists of a retailer, who acts as a follower and a manufacturer who acts as a leader. Moreover, we consider two situations: in the vertical orientation, two manufacturers individually make carbon reduction decisions; in the horizontal orientation, two manufacturers make carbon emission abatement decisions simultaneously. Besides, comparison of the optimal solutions are discussed under two situations, the results indicate that: (1) the government can encourage manufacturers to optimize the abatement rate of their products by imposing appropriate carbon taxes under two situations. (2) As long as carbon taxation occurs, each supply chain members’ vertical collaboration will drop carbon emission rate and product price. (3) When each chain is a decentralized system, although the horizontal collaboration between manufacturers improves the abatement rate of products, it reduces both retailers’ profits and customers’ interests. (4) The two-part tariff contract proposed by the downstream retailers can induce the two manufacturers to abandon their collaboration. This contract can not only realize Pareto improvement for supply chain members, but also protect the environment because of the larger abatement rate. (5) When the fixed fee falls into a certain range, the two-part tariff contract can yield a larger system benefit. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Pricing carbon emissions from an individual jurisdiction may harm the competitiveness of local firms, causing the leakage of emissions and economic activity to other regions. Past research concentrates on national carbon prices, but the impacts of subnational carbon prices could be more severe due to the openness of regional economies. We specify a flexible model to capture competition between a plant in a state with electric sector carbon pricing and plants in other states or countries without such pricing. Treating energy prices as a proxy for carbon prices, we estimate model parameters using confidential plant-level Census data, 1982–2011. We simulate the effects on manufacturing output and employment of carbon prices covering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. A carbon price of $10 per metric ton on electricity output reduces employment in the regulated region by 2.1 percent, and raises employment in nearby states by 0.8 percent, although these estimates do not account for revenue recycling in the RGGI region that could mitigate these employment changes. The effects on output are broadly similar. National employment falls just 0.1 percent, suggesting that domestic plants in other states as opposed to foreign facilities gain the most jobs from state or regional carbon pricing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper assesses the use of full-employment computable-general equilibrium (CGE) models to evaluate labor-market effects of environmental policy. Specifically, it compares a full-employment model to two alternatives: a Balistreri model that introduces unemployment through an endogenous wage premium and a search-CGE model that uses a search-and-matching friction to introduce unemployment (extending Hafstead and Williams). We find that some key results are robust across the three models, such as the reallocation of labor across sectors in response to a carbon tax, but that small differences for each industry add up to larger differences across models at the aggregate level. Applying a full-time-equivalent assumption to the full-employment model seriously overestimates the economy-wide net change in jobs (by a factor of more than 2.4 for a carbon tax with revenues returned lump sum and by a factor of almost 2.7 when carbon tax revenue reduces payroll taxes) relative to the search-CGE model. © 2022 The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

AB  - With the booming development of industrial parks in southern Belt and Road (B&R) countries, the demand for energy carriers such as electricity and steam grows rapidly. One key aspect of B&R initiative is to promote cross-border energy cooperation in these countries. However, this region has abundant renewable energy resources, while the electricity and steam supply required in industrial processes is insufficient. This paper proposes a cross-border integrated energy system (IES) based on Carnot battery technology. A steam Carnot battery (SCB) is designed based on phase change material with water/steam as the working fluid. This paper establishes thermodynamic model of the proposed IES and evaluates its performance. Based on a field investigation in a real cross-border China-Myanmar industrial park, this paper designs the corresponding IES and studies SCB's impact on IES daily operation. A baseline IES having an electric battery is also proposed to facilitate the comparison. The result shows that IES based on SCB reduces 28.57% operating cost, 43.49% carbon emission, and 16.49% city grid electricity consumption compared with the baseline. This means electro-thermal complementarity is an essential feature of SCB in IES. Furthermore, shadow price approach is adopted to analyze the impact of SCB in IES with the development of the industrial park. Renewable electricity output and peak-valley ratio have high shadow prices. The operating cost of IES based on SCB is highly affected by the percentage of renewable energy introduction and pricing market, making it a promising choice in this region known for redundant hydropower. Although electricity storage capacity and SCB's roundtrip efficiency have less impact on cost reduction, they can reduce carbon emission for IES. This study provides a new perspective for constructing the energy system in B&R initiative areas. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - With the global transition towards net-zero carbon buildings and carbon neutrality, peer-to-peer energy trading plays a significant role in mitigating spatio-temporal mismatches between on-site renewable energy generation and energy consumption. However, dynamic peer-to-peer trading prices and prosumer preference satisfaction with the dynamic peer-to-peer trading prices have not been fully considered to incentivize prosumers' participation in the sharing scheme. This research aims to provide frontier guidelines on peer-to-peer energy trading mechanisms and synergistic peer-to-peer sharing strategies to achieve the ‘win–win-win’ collaboration mode, so as to promote low-carbon and sustainable transformations. In this study, a Stackelberg game theory-based integrated community energy system is proposed, comprising hybrid solar-wind renewables, energy storage system, grid-connected prosumers, and energy sharing providers. Dynamic peer-to-peer trading price is set based on the fair cost-benefit allocation among prosumers through Nash bargaining. Results indicate that peer-to-peer trading reduces operational carbon emissions by over 24 %, shifting from 865 kg CO2,e reduction to 1073 kg CO2,e reduction. Load-shifting within peer-to-peer trading improves self-consumed renewable energy from 46 % to 70 %, covering electricity demand with renewables from 50 % to 74 %. Identified peer-to-peer trading prices for hotel, office, and residential buildings are 0.59 CNY/kWh, 0.15 CNY/kWh, and 0.46 CNY/kWh, respectively. Compared to traditional prosumer-to-grid trading, peer-to-peer trading reduces costs from 2394 CNY to 448 CNY, stimulating the proactivity of multi-stakeholders. Overall, peer-to-peer energy trading brings a further utilization of the renewable energy, and largely decreases the reliance on grid electricity, leading to great benefits from the techno-environmental-economic aspects. However, peer-to-peer energy trading should be continuously investigated under uncertainty prediction and sustainable business models to ensure its robust implementation and long-term feasibility. © 2024 International Solar Energy Society

AB  - In rural areas, diesel generators are prevalent due to their lower initial cost, despite inefficiencies and carbon emissions. Transitioning to PV/Battery/Diesel systems offers a solution by reducing costs and emissions. However, the high upfront expenses present a significant barrier, particularly for rural communities, necessitating external financial support. This study evaluates the benefits of adopting a PV/Battery/Diesel hybrid system over traditional diesel generators in a rural community with 25 customers and a daily demand of 50 kWh. The proposed system includes a 12 kWp photovoltaic array and a 48 kWh battery bank, simulated using Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software. Results indicate a 91% renewable fraction and a cost of energy of 0.279 USD/kWh, substantially lower than the 1.05 USD/kWh of diesel-only systems, with CO2 savings of 25 t per year. The paper advocates for a case study approach to green mechanism, urging energy and environmental companies to invest in these systems. By replacing diesel generators with hybrid PV/Diesel/Battery systems, companies can offer electricity at a reduced cost, driving adoption. Selling carbon credits from emission savings can generate additional income, leveraging CO2 tax incentives. Under scenarios where investors cover 50% of diesel costs, selling electricity yields 9581 USD annually, and selling CO2 credits generates 500 USD annually. This leads to a payback period of 9.83 years without CO2 credits and 9.18 years with CO2 credits, totaling 46,848 USD without CO2 credits and 52,927 USD with CO2 credits over the project's lifespan. Meanwhile, adjusting electricity pricing to 75% of diesel costs, this increases annual income from electricity sales to 14,372 USD. This reduces the payback period to 5.89 years without CO2 credits and 5.66 years with CO2 credits, totaling 105,094 USD without CO2 credits and 111,174 USD with CO2 credits at the end of the project. © The Author(s) 2024.

AB  - This paper develops a two-stage optimal dispatch model for a demand-response power system based on carbon emission flow theory. First, we design the mathematical counterpart for the economic dispatch of the rural distribution network as the first-stage optimization model. Next, we utilize the carbon responsibility sharing method to delineate the range of load-side carbon responsibility. Consequently, we propose a customized plan with stepped carbon pricing. Then, we calculate the load-side carbon responsibility and carbon emission cost based on the carbon emission flow theory. Subsequently, we model a two-stage optimization for low carbon optimal dispatch with demand response, and the carbon price is regarded as the signal. This promising solution leverages the load-side regulation ability to reduce total carbon emissions, consequently lowering the load-side carbon emission cost. Finally, we analyze two custom scenarios with the improved PJM-5 node system: 1) All power units are thermal power units; 2) The system operates with thermal power units and wind turbines. The results demonstrate that the proposed model accurately calculates carbon emission responsibilities and effectively reduces system-wide carbon emissions. This validates the rationality and feasibility of our proposed model.  © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - This study examines how electric utilities and regulators can encourage residential consumers to conserve electricity during the hottest summer days and shift electricity load from the day to off-peak, nighttime hours. We analyze a two-year field experiment involving 280 Texas households that explores approaches to conservation and load-shifting to enable emission reductions and reduce generation costs. Our critical peak pricing intervention reduces electricity consumption by 14% on the peak hours of the hottest days, leading to greenhouse gas emission reductions of about 16%. A key contribution of this study is the use of high-frequency appliance-level data. We show that 74% of the critical peak response is from reducing air conditioning. In a complementary nighttime pilot program, consumers respond strongly to lower prices by programming the timing of electric vehicle charging. Our work highlights how automation can influence the consumer tradeoffs relating to effort costs, discomfort, monetary incentives, and warm glow. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - This work proposes a framework to solve demand-side management (DSM) problem by systematically scheduling energy consumption using flat pricing scheme (FPS) in smart grid (SG). The framework includes microgrid with renewable energy sources (solar and wind), energy storage systems, electric vehicles (EVs), and building appliances like time flexible, power flexible, and base/critical appliances. For the proposed framework, we develop an ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm, which efficiently schedules smart appliances, and EVs batteries charging/discharging with microgrid and without (W/O) microgrid under FPS to minimize energy cost, carbon emission, and peak to average ratio (PAR). An integrated technique of enhanced differential evolution (EDE) algorithm and artificial neural network (ANN) is devised to predict solar irradiance and wind speed for accurate microgrid energy estimation. To endorse the applicability of the proposed framework, simulations are conducted. Moreover, the proposed framework based on the ACO algorithm is compared to mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) and W/O scheduling energy management frameworks in terms of energy cost, carbon emission, and PAR. The developed ACO algorithm reduces energy cost, PAR, and carbon emission by 23.69%, 26.20%, and 15.35% in scenario I, and 25.09%, 31.45%, and 18.50% in scenario II, respectively, as compared to W/O scheduling case. The results affirm the applicability of the proposed framework in aspects of the desired objectives. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The carbon emission rights option (CERO), as a real option, can be used to measure market volatility risk and help enterprises obtain income. However, traditional option pricing models mostly operate under risk neutrality and are unsuitable for CERO pricing. Quantum finance, as a branch of economic physics, can effectively improve the uncertain behavior of financial markets. Therefore, in order to obtain more reasonable results, the study designs a quantum Monte Carlo simulation method for pricing CERO under risk uncertainty. Firstly, real options theory, quantum computing, Monte Carlo simulation, and stochastic volatility (SV) model are combined to achieve quantum state preparation and payoff calculation on quantum circuits. Then, quantum algorithms are used to achieve CERO dynamic pricing. Finally, a case study is conducted using data from the Beijing Green Exchange to verify the convergence and rationality of Quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and its optimization algorithm in CERO pricing. The study results indicate that among the four QAE algorithms adopted, the results of two quantum algorithms are close to the traditional method and have good convergence. Compared to traditional method, the study solves the problem of difficult parameter determination in CERO pricing and reduces the results subjectivity. However, not all quantum algorithms are suitable for CERO pricing. The study further designed various carbon emission trading decisions among enterprises based on pricing results, providing a new approach for the management and operation of carbon assets in enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Equitable climate policies are required for a just and rapid energy transition. A widely discussed climate policy instrument is carbon taxes. Previous studies of the distributional implications of carbon taxation focused on uniform carbon taxes across sectors. Differentiated tax rates across goods and services received less attention. Here we model an alternative carbon tax design accounting for the distribution of household consumption and carbon footprints across 88 countries covering the global north and south. The policy distinguishes luxury and basic consumption and sets higher carbon prices for luxury. The policy reduces yearly global household emissions by 6% compared with no policy and inequalities are reduced compared with no policy and compared with a uniform carbon tax. By 2050, the policy saves around 100 gigatonnes carbon dioxide equivalents, which is 75% of what is needed for households to remain within a 2° consistent climate pathway. © 2023 The Authors

AB  - As global energy demand rises and climate change poses an increasing threat, the development of sustainable, low-carbon energy solutions has become imperative. This study focuses on optimizing shared energy storage (SES) and distribution networks (DNs) using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) techniques to enhance operation and decision-making capability. An innovative dynamic carbon intensity calculation method is proposed, which more accurately calculates indirect carbon emissions of the power system through network topology in both spatial and temporal dimensions, thereby refining carbon responsibility allocation on the user side. Additionally, we integrate user-side SES and ladder-type carbon emission pricing into DN to create a low-carbon economic dispatch model. By framing the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), we employ the DRL, specifically the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm, enhanced with prioritized experience replay (PER) and orthogonal regularization (OR), to achieve both economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. The simulation results indicate that this method significantly reduces the operating costs and carbon emissions of DN. This study offers an innovative perspective on the synergistic optimization of SES with DN and provides a practical methodology for low-carbon economic dispatch in power systems. © 2024 by the authors.

AB  - Electrification and distributed energy resources (DERs) are vital for reducing the building sector's carbon footprint. However, conventional reactive control is insufficient in addressing many current building-operation-related challenges, impeding building decarbonization. To reduce building carbon emissions, it is essential to consider dynamic grid electricity mix and incorporate the coordination between DERs and building energy systems in building control. This study develops a novel model predictive control (MPC)-based integrated energy management framework for buildings with multiple DERs considering dynamic grid electricity mix and pricing. A linear, integrated high-fidelity model encompassing adaptive thermal comfort, building thermodynamics, humidity, space conditioning, water heating, renewable energy, electric energy storage, and electric vehicle, is developed. An MPC controller is developed based on this model. To demonstrate the applicability, the developed framework is applied to a single-family home with an energy management system through whole-year simulations considering three climate zones: warm, mixed, and cold. In the simulations, the framework reduces the whole-building electricity costs and carbon emissions by 11.9% - 38.3% and 7.2% - 25.1%, respectively, compared to conventional control. Furthermore, the framework can reduce percent discomfort time from 25.7% - 47.4% to nearly 0%, compared to conventional control. The framework also can shift 86.4% - 100% of peak loads to off-peak periods, while conventional control cannot achieve such performance. The case study results also suggest that pursuing cost savings is possible in tandem with carbon emission reduction to achieve co-benefits (e.g., simultaneous 37.7% and 21.9% reductions in electricity costs and carbon emissions, respectively) with the proposed framework. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The coordinated energy management of "source-load-storage" is essential to achieve maximum energy savings and emission reductions while reducing the economic costs of both source and load. Compared with existing work, this paper aims to incentivize the joint reduction of carbon emissions from both the source and the load by apportioning the precise responsibility for carbon emissions to each subject. Concretely, this paper proposes a two-stage low carbon optimal scheduling model based on source-load coordination. In the first stage, the costs and carbon emissions on the source side are reduced according to the real-time demand of the load nodes, the responsibility for carbon emissions is apportioned in detail according to the results of the optimal tide and a carbon trading mechanism is proposed. It is worth noting that the trading mechanism can reflect both the effects of load size, spatial and temporal differences. The second stage aims to minimize the sum of the daily operating costs of customer microgrids (MGs) subject to the uncertainty of distributed generation (DG), electricity trading mechanisms, carbon trading mechanisms, smart devices and conventional energy storage devices. Therefore, this paper proposes a real-time rolling optimal scheduling method for daily electricity consumption by introducing cloud energy storage (CES) rental services. Hence, this paper proposes a real-time rolling optimal dispatching method for daily electricity consumption by introducing CES rental services. Finally, an arithmetic analysis is carried out based on the improved PJM-5 node system for scenarios containing multiple types of generating units. The results show that the method reduces costs on both the generation side and the load side, with significant reductions in carbon emissions. In addition, the impact of different pricing criteria for trading mechanisms on scheduling outcomes is explored. © 2023

AB  - Congestion pricing and License Plate Rationing (LPR) are classical transportation policies targeting travel demand. Travelers are constrained to reduce their cars’ usage to improve traffic conditions or decrease exhaust gases emissions. They have already been proven effective in the field but have also received some criticism for being unfair or badly perceived by users. On the other side, Tradable Credit and Permit Schemes (TCS/TPS) have been investigated in the literature for more than a decade but have never been implemented in practice. In this paper, we present a large-scale dynamic simulation study, corresponding to the morning peak hour for the Lyon city (France) to benchmark pricing, LPR, TCS, and TPS in terms of modal shift from personal cars to Public Transportation (PT), over a horizon of several days and with different charging schemes. Congestion dynamic in the transportation system is reproduced using a trip-based Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD) framework. We compute the modal assignment at equilibrium by iteratively solving a Quadratic Problem (QP). The initial formulation, presented in previous work for a single day and a uniform TCS, is extended to account for different days, validity cycles, charging schemes, and TPS. The benchmarking shows that the TCS outperforms LPR in terms of both social cost and carbon emissions. Making credit valid over multiple days reduces the price variability while keeping the same system performances and gain distributions. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2022.

AB  - Climate change and extreme weather caused by the greenhouse effect have attracted global attention. Governments and public sectors are beginning to recognize the importance of reducing carbon emissions and have reached a consensus on “carbon neutrality.” This study investigates the strategic choice of carbon quota allocation methods within a supply chain framework, involving a policy maker (government), a manufacturer, and a retailer. At the outset, the government selects either the grandfather-based allocation method (Method G) or the benchmark-based allocation method (Method B) to regulate the manufacturer's carbon emissions. Subsequently, the manufacturer determines the level of carbon emission reduction and wholesale pricing, and the retailer sets the order quantity based on the manufacturer's decision. Drawing on equilibrium outcomes, this research compares the optimal decisions of firms, carbon emissions, consumer surplus, overall social welfare, and supply chain sustainability under these two methods. The research highlights several major findings. First, regardless of which allocation method is adopted, a rise of the initial carbon emission in producing process will lead to an increase in the wholesale price, but a decrease in emission reduction level and the order quantity. Second, under method B, the manufacturer reduces more carbon emission. Third, from the social welfare perspective, the method B/G is a better choice for the government when the environmental damage coefficient is relatively low/high. Fourth, when carbon quota and the initial carbon emission meet some certain conditions, the method B can achieve environmental sustainability and economic sustainability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Internal carbon pricing (ICP) has emerged as an increasingly popular tool for firms to cut emissions and combat climate change risks. We theorize the role of ICP by integrating legitimacy and stakeholder perspectives into dynamic capability theory. We argue that firms implement ICP to comply with stakeholders’ expectations, leading to corporate environmental strategic transformation which in turn improve a firm's dynamic capabilities. Furthermore, we argue that the heterogeneous nature of corporate motivation for such strategy transformation, reflected by carbon dependency and corporate climate target, moderates the relationship between the extent of ICP and the environmental outcomes. The Carbon Disclosure Project data of 500 U.S. publicly listed firms confirms that ICP reduces carbon emissions per employee and carbon emissions per revenue by 13.5% and 15.7%, respectively. Collectively, we advance understanding of corporate business strategy in the presence of climate change risks, posing both theoretical and practical policy implications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The integration of a heat pump (HP) with a combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) to control the inlet air temperature is a promising technology to meet the requirements imposed by the current electricity systems in terms of efficiency and flexibility. If the HP is coupled with a thermal energy storage (TES) in an inlet conditioning unit (ICU), it can be exploited in different modes to enhance the off-design CCGT's efficiency or to boost the power output at full load. Furthermore, fuel-saving would be reflected in avoided emissions. The optimal sizing of the ICU, as well as an accurate estimation of the benefits, is a complex problem influenced by several factors such as the local climate and electricity market prices. This paper aims to systematically investigate, utilizing a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for optimal dispatch, the feasibility of an ICU integration in different scenarios (EU and US). Different electricity markets have been analyzed and classified according to the parameters describing the average and variability of prices, the interdependency with the gas market, the ambient temperature, or the local carbon pricing policy. The most favorable conditions are identified and the dependency of the optimal ICU sizing on the climate and the electricity market is highlighted. This paper provides information for a first viability assessment: the concept appears to be highly profitable in hot regions with high price variability. Additionally, even in less profitable conditions (i.e., stable low prices in a cold climate), the system increases operating hours and reduces economic losses. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

AB  - This paper provides an overview of the power sector in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) with the latest data and applies a retrospective modeling approach for its power market under (i) a cost minimization and (ii) an environmental impact minimization objective for the period 2003-2013 with domestic and international fuel prices. For the analysis an enhanced version of Open Source energy MOdelling SYStem (OSeMOSYS) is utilized. Implemented model improvements include (a) temperature adjustments as the temperature difference between winter and summer of 20-30 °C is common almost all over the world and has significant impact on power generation efficiency, (b) a multi-objective target function considering both costs and emissions to create a Pareto frontier, and (c) emissions are assessed with the 'quality enhanced life days' (QELD) indicator to consider global (e.g. carbon dioxide) and local emissions (e.g. NOx) simultaneously. Results show that the biggest reductions in emissions can be reached by considering international fuel prices. While the amount of new technology is quite similar within the minimize emission cases, the installed type of technology differs significantly within the minimize cost cases: cost minimization with international fuel prices is forcing Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT or CC) plants and Steam Turbine (ST) plants whereas when considering domestic fuel prices, the share of inefficient Open Cycle Gas Turbine (OCGT or GT) plants is 100%. Focusing on emission reduction within the international fuel price scenario a 19% cost increase results in 43% emission reductions while a 33% cost increase reduces emissions by 60%. Notably, an emission reduction of 50% can be reached independently of fuel pricing when the weight of emission criterion is 95% or higher within the enhanced OSeMOSYS model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Global carbon pricing can yield revenues which are large enough to create significant global pro-poor redistributive opportunities. We analyze alternative multidecade growth trajectories from 2015 to 2105 for major global economies with carbon tax rates designed to stabilize emissions in the presence of both continued country growth and autonomous energy use efficiency improvement. In our central case analysis, revenues from globally internalizing carbon pricing rise to 8 % and then fall to 6 % of gross world product. High growth in India and China reduces global inequality and poverty strongly over time, but important incremental redistributive effects can be achieved using global carbon pricing revenues. Taking into account both between-country effects and previous literature estimates of within-country effects, a global carbon tax alone tends to be regressive in its global incidence. However, if its revenues are redistributed globally via equal per capita transfers, in our central case the Gini coefficient for world income falls by about 3 % and the share of the bottom decile rises by 81 % on average from 2015 to 2105. The population living in poverty falls by 16 % in 2015. Going further, global poverty could be eliminated entirely by 2015 according to our calculations if one third of global carbon tax revenues were redistributed directly to the poorest individuals. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In the battle against climate change, electrification plays an increasingly large role in our society. The growing use of electricity networks requires advanced coordination mechanisms to avoid the tragedy of the commons. In this paper, we explore the effects of optimum time-dependent pricing (TDP) on supplier surplus within electricity markets, using a parameterized optimization model. Varying not only the prices themselves, but also their announcement horizon, we show how the suppliers’ optimal decision depends on risk aversion, forecasting quality, and end-user flexibility. The inclusion of procurement risk in our model shows that TDP can be beneficial for suppliers when they want to actively manage risk, even if expected profits are lower. At the same time, the shifting of end-user demand to low-cost times reduces the overall system cost, and potentially carbon emissions. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) is one of the mainstays of today's society that provides major impacts on our professional, private lives but also most important drivers of economic growth. It is very true that fossil fuel combustion produces carbon dioxide, which is the cause of the greenhouse effect. This Greenhouse effect is the major reason for climate change. Therefore, this climate change problem is related to an energy challenge. The effective measure that reduces carbon emission is the replacement of conventional combustion fossil fuel into renewable energies like solar, wind, water, tides and geothermal heat. In order to recover the climate change, we require greenhouse gas reduction using renewable sources with effective ICTs. ICT embedded renewable energy storage system can enable wider geographic scopes of grid integration, optimized energy demand management and dynamic pricing.

AB  - Traffic is a major contributor to emissions in many large cities with severe air pollution. Experience in London, Milan, and Stockholm shows that charging for the use of roads can be effective in reducing emissions, as well as congestion. This study examines the use of predictive cordon tolls based on weather forecasts to reduce ambient air pollution and congestion. Travelers choose their destinations inside or outside the cordon, and whether to drive or take public transport. Passenger vehicles are divided into three classes according to their emission characteristics, and higher tolls are imposed on more polluting vehicles. The Box model of emission dispersion is used to predict air quality. A Markov decision-making process then determines daily toll levels with the objective of maximizing welfare measured by travelers’ surplus, toll revenue, and air pollution health costs. The model is applied to a hypothetical network using recorded weather data for Tehran in 2016. With base-case parameter values, predictive pricing reduces the daily average CO concentration as well as the number of days with dangerous air quality. Predictive pricing yields a higher welfare gain than a fixed toll (i.e., the same every day regardless of weather conditions). The effects of weather information, wind forecast accuracy, forecast time horizon, values of travel time, destination attractions, and road link capacity on the benefits from predictive pricing are analyzed. The performance of the model under randomized weather conditions is also assessed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Biomass can be relatively easily stored and transported compared with other types of renewable energy sources. Crop straw can be converted into densified solid biofuel via briquette fuel technology to expand its possible applications and enhance its utilisation efficiency. However, the potential economic, environmental and social impacts of crop straw briquette fuel need to be assessed before its large-scale use. This paper provides a comprehensive evaluation of these impacts for a fully-operating 2×104 t/a corn stalk briquette fuel plant in China. The results show that with a life time of 15 years, a purchase price of 150 RMB/t for corn stalk and the current sales price of 400 RMB/t for briquette fuel, the plant has a net present value of 9.6 million RMB or 1.5 million USD, an internal rate of return of 36% and a short investment payback period of 4.4 years. The life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are found to be 323 t CO2,e/year or 1kg CO2,e/GJ, much lower than that of coal. Additionally, the process reduces pollution by decreasing the amount of corn stalk that is discarded or burnt directly in the field. In terms of social impacts, the use of corn stalk briquetting fuel plant is expected to play an important role in increasing local residents' income, improving rural ecological environments, alleviating energy shortages, guaranteeing energy security, and promoting socialism new rural reconstruction. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We use a set of economic experiments to test the effects of some novel features of California's new controls on greenhouse gas emissions. The California cap and trade scheme imposes limits on allowance ownership, uses a tiered price containment reserve sale, and settles allowance auctions based on the lowest accepted bid. We examine the effects of these features on market liquidity, efficiency, and price variability. We find that tight holding limits substantially reduce banking, which, in turn reduces market liquidity. This impairs the ability of traders to smooth prices over time, resulting in lower efficiency and higher price variability. The price containment reserve, while increasing the supply of allowances available to traders, does not appear to mitigate the effects of tight holding limits on market outcomes. As a result, the imposition of holding limits in the allowance market may have the consequence of increasing the likelihood of the market manipulation that they were intended to prevent. Finally, we find that the choice between lowest accepted bid and highest rejected bid for the allowance auction pricing rule does not have a significant effect on market outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The consensus findings from climate scientists regarding potential future climate change and associated damages have become increasingly ominous over the last decade. These findings reveal that in the absence of significant reductions in CO2 emissions, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 stand a significant chance of causing increases in global average surface temperature that are large enough to produce very serious climate-related damages within a decade or two. They imply that stronger policy action-beyond what has been pledged in the 2015 Paris Accord-is urgently needed. This article has indicated how economists can help reveal more clearly the urgency of stronger policy action. Such clarification requires policy evaluations that focus more sharply on the timing of policy action and the economic costs that result from delayed implementation. I have shown that economists can achieve this sharper focus in several ways. One is simply to place greater emphasis on the fact that earlier action reduces costs. A second is to expand the development and application of numerical models that reveal the economic impacts on key stakeholder groups. Such models provide information relevant to political feasibility and the prospects for near-term implementation. A third is to include attention to the timing of implementation in comparisons of the costs of policy alternatives. Other things being equal, a policy that is likely to be implemented sooner will have a cost advantage. A fourth is to apply IAMs to alternative emissions scenarios designed to isolate the costs of delay. These costs reflect either the additional climate damages from the higher future concentrations attributable to delayed emissions reductions or the extra abatement costs attributable to the future acceleration of emissions reductions that would be needed to avoid the future increase in concentrations that otherwise would result from delay. As discussed here, greater attention to the prospects for near-term implementation can alter the cost rankings of U.S. climate policy alternatives, increasing the attractiveness of some climate policy approaches that economists might otherwise tend to dismiss. While carbon pricing has several advantages over other instruments for CO2 abatement, I would argue that consideration of the prospects for near-term implementation justifies giving alternative approaches a closer look. By bringing out more effectively the significance of the timing of policy implementation and the costs of delay, economists can provide better guidance to policymakers struggling to address what is arguably the world's most urgent and important environmental problem. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - This study examines cellulosic crop residues for biopower production in the context of (greenhouse gas) GHGemission mitigation. We employ sector modeling to simulate future market potential for biopower production from crop residues. Our findings suggest that in order for crop residues to have any role in electricity generation either the carbon or (carbon dioxide) CO2equivalent GHG price must rise to about 15 dollars per ton or the price of coal has to increase to about 43 dollars per ton. We find that crop residues with higher heat content have greater opportunities in biopower production than the residues with lower heat content. In addition, our evidence shows that improvements in crop yields do not have much impact on biopower production. However, the energy recovery efficiency does have significant positive impact but only if the CO2 equivalent price rises substantially. Moreover, our analysis indicates the desirability of cofiring biomass as opposed to 100% replacement because this reduces transportation cost and increases the efficiency of heat recovery. In terms of policy implications, imposing carbon emission pricing could be an important step in inducing electric power producers to include biomass feedstocks in their fuel-mix power generation portfolios and achieve GHG emission reductions. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A streamlined model, applied at the member state level, is used to evaluate possibilities for greater reliance on carbon pricing to meet the European Union's mitigation pledge for the Paris Agreement. The economic welfare costs of currently envisioned policies—including the Emissions Trading System (ETS), requirements for energy efficiency, vehicle emission rates, and national targets for non-ETS emissions—are estimated at 1.1% of EU GDP in 2030, or €167 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) reduced. On net these policies lose a small amount of revenue (0.05% of EU GDP). A series of reforms progressively extending emissions pricing across sectors and countries reduces costs by about 0.6% of 2030 EU GDP, or €90 per ton of CO2 reduced, while increasing revenues by almost 1% of EU GDP. Higher emissions prices in the EU ETS would create the largest welfare gain, and no country is made worse off from this reform. © 2019

AB  - This paper surveys pricing mechanisms used by government agencies to manage congestion, as well as highlights the many political and social issues that have to be addressed in order to implement a pricing mechanism. This survey was undertaken in order to be able to understand how congestion pricing could be used to help manage airspace capacity. This is an important question since a 2008 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress suggested that domestic air traffic delays in 2007 cost the economy as much as $41 billion, including $19 billion in increased operational costs for the airlines and $12 billion worth of lost time for passengers.The paper begins by surveying roadway congestion approaches throughout the world. We survey the successes that peak pricing charges have had on reducing congestion. We also report the other benefits that such practices have had: improving the public transportation network, improving the economy of the region, reducing carbon emissions, and creating new urban living spaces. We next examine other applications of congestion pricing, including managing demand for canal and bridges passage, port usage, access to city centers, and peak use of energy resources.The paper ends with a proposal for a two-staged approach to the management of air space and runway congestion. The first stage imposes a service standard on runway access that is consistent with an airport's capacity during good weather days. Then, when weather reduces capacity either in the airspace or on runways, we propose a congestion pricing mechanism that charges flights based on the amount of congestion the flight imposes on the entire system. © 2012.

AB  - Carbon emissions trading policy is a market mechanism which promotes global greenhouse gas emissions reduction and reduces global carbon dioxide emissions. The emissions reduction in the supply chain operation has become a hot issue in supply chain management. Thus, this paper studies the optimal cap setting and pricing in chain-to-chain system under carbon emissions trading mechanism. Based on the double decentralized scenario, the five different cooperation models are established by introducing the structural cooperation and the contractual cooperation (the wholesale price contract) of supply chains. The optimal solutions of these models are obtained through the Stackelberg game and Nash game. The results show that the bargaining power of the supply chains is changed by the asymmetric competition structure. Besides, the government should emphasize the influencing factors change of the cap in the process of setting carbon emissions cap.  © 2021 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Increased emissions of anthropogenic carbon dioxide over the last two centuries correlate convincingly with increases in average global temperature to confirm that CO2 emissions are an important source for recent climate change (Petit et al. 1999). As well as being an important greenhouse gas, CO2 is an effective solvent for hydrocarbons making it an excellent fluid for miscible reservoir flooding (CO2 EOR). Geological storage of CO2, in saline aquifers and depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs, is considered an essential technology for realizing the 2°C limit scenario agreed in the Copenhagen Accord (IEA 2014). However, the business case for Carbone Capture and Storage (CCS) is currently stalled mainly due to a lack of agreement on a viable CO2 pricing policy. An alternative option called CCUS, that involves utilization of captured CO2 for EOR purposes, is therefore being considered a method to finance and stimulate large-scale CCS projects. If the CO2 source is anthropogenic, and injected CO2 is allowed to remain in the reservoir, and if the operation is monitored to insure permanent sequestration of injected CO2, CCUS can be considered as a valid strategy for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In the CCS process, CO2 is normally injected into brine-filled geological traps. CO2 displaces in-situ brine and segregates in the reservoir due to a strong density contrast between CO2 and brine; the resultant sweep efficiency, for cases where CO2 is injected from a limited perforated interval in a single well, is very poor as confirmed by seismic and gravity observations (Singh et al. 2010; Alnes et al. 2011). Supercritical CO2 has a gas-like viscosity when injected into an oil reservoir for EOR purposes. The viscosity difference between in-situ hydrocarbons and injected CO2 results in viscosity fingering and early breakthrough at the producers; this typically decreases both the vertical and areal sweep efficiencies. Swing injection techniques have been proposed to control properties of the CO2 injection blend in order to improve sweep efficiency of the injected phase (Nazarian et al. 2013). CO2 Composition Swing Injection (CSI) is a novel injection technology that provides the operator of a CO2 injection project with some control over the CO2 front movement both in saline aquifer storage and in CO2 flood for hydrocarbon production. The composition of the injected stream is manipulated to reduce gravity override in reservoirs with a large gravity number, resulting in a more uniform gas-water front. The advantages of the CSI injection approach for CO2 storage operations are capacity enhancement and a reduced seepage risk. CSI injection, when applied to a CO2 EOR flood, reduces the unwanted segregation of the CO2-rich phase, increasing the sweep efficiency. The properties of the injected stream can be designed, at little cost, to lower the viscosity and density contrast with the in-situ reservoir fluids. This reduces the segregation and fingering of CO2, which results in a more uniform and controlled displacement front. Compared to conventional methods for front stabilization such as the use of viscosifiers and CO2 WAG, the CSI method can provide a more affordable alternative. The properties of the injected stream can also be controlled by changing the injection temperature (Nazarian et al. 2013) - a technique called Temperature Swing Injection (TSI). This technique gives the operator a relatively affordable method to control the properties of the injected blend by changing the injection temperature. This paper explains the concept behind the swing injection techniques and reports simulation results from realistic models that address the performance of these techniques for CCS and CO2 EOR.

AB  - We investigate the impact of pricing policies (i.e., flat pricing versus peak pricing) on the investment levels of a utility firm in two competing energy sources (renewable and conventional), with a focus on the renewable investment level.We consider generation patterns and intermittency of solar and wind energy in relation to the electricity demand throughout a day. Industry experts generally promote peak pricing policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the supply system.We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower renewable energy investments. Our study suggests that reducing carbon emissions through increasing renewable energy investments requires careful attention to the pricing policy and the market characteristics of each region.

AB  - Heterogeneous fleet vehicles can be used to reduce carbon emissions. We propose an improved branch-and-price (BAP) algorithm to precisely solve the heterogeneous fleet green vehicle routing problem with time windows (HFGVRPTW). In the improved BAP, to speed up the solution for the pricing problem, we develop a multi-vehicle approximate dynamic programming (MVADP) algorithm that is based on the labeling algorithm. The MVADP algorithm reduces labels by integrating the calculation of pricing problems for all vehicle types. In addition, to rapidly obtain a tighter upper bound, we propose an integer branch method. For each branch, we solve the master problem with the integer constraint by the CPLEX solver using the columns produced by column generation. We retain the smaller of the obtained integer solution and the current upper bound, and the branches are thus reduced significantly. Extensive computational experiments were performed on the Solomon benchmark instances. The results show that the branches and computational time were reduced significantly by the improved BAP algorithm. © 2019

AB  - The economics of membrane distillation (MD) and common seawater desalination methods including multi effect distillation (MED), multistage flash (MSF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are compared. MD also has the opportunity to enhance RO recovery, demonstrated experimentally on RO concentrate from groundwater. MD concentrated RO brine to 361,000mg/L total dissolved solids, an order of magnitude more saline than typical seawater, validating this potential. On a reference 30,000m3/day plant, MD has similar economics with other thermal desalination techniques, but RO is more cost effective. With the inclusion of a carbon tax of $23 per tonne carbon in Australia, RO remained the economically favourable process. However, when heat comes at a cost equivalent of 10% of the value of the steam needed for MD and MED, under a carbon tax regime, the cost of MD reduces to $0.66/m3 which is cheaper than RO and MED. The favour to MD was due to lower material cost. On low thermally, high electrically efficient installations MD can desalinate water from low temperature (<50°C) heat sources at a cost of $0.57/m3. Our assessment has found that generally, MD opportunities occur when heat is available at low cost, while extended recovery of RO brine is also viable. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This paper explores a Post Keynesian, 'new economics' approach to climate policy, assessing the opportunities for investment in accelerated decarbonisation of the global economy to 2020 following the Great Recession of 2008-2009. The risks associated with business-as-usual growth in greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in the atmosphere suggest that avoiding dangerous climate change will require that the world's energy-economy system is transformed through switching to low-carbon technologies and lifestyles. Governments have agreed a target to hold the increase in temperatures above pre-industrial levels to at most 2°C and have offered reductions by 2020 in GHG emissions or the carbon-intensity of GDP. The effects of policies proposed to achieve pathways to 2020 towards this target are assessed using E3MG, an Energy-Environment-Economy (E3) Model at the Global level. E3MG is an annual simulation econometric model, estimated for 20 world regions over 1972-2006 adopting a new economics approach. Additional low-GHG investment of some 0.7% of GDP, with carbon pricing and other policies, is sufficient to achieve a pathway consistent with a medium chance of achieving the long-term target. GDP is above reference levels because decarbonisation reduces world oil prices and increases investment. Employment is some 0.9% above reference levels by 2020 and public finances are almost unaffected. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Due to rapid population growth, technology, and economic development, electricity demand is rising, causing a gap between energy production and demand. With the emergence of the smart grid, residents can schedule their energy usage in response to the Demand Response (DR) program offered by a utility company to cope with the gap between demand and supply. This work first proposes a novel optimization-based energy management framework that adapts consumer power usage patterns using real-time pricing signals and generation from utility and photovoltaic-battery systems to minimize electricity cost, to reduce carbon emission, and to mitigate peak power consumption subjected to alleviating rebound peak generation. Secondly, a Hybrid Genetic Ant Colony Optimization (HGACO) algorithm is proposed to solve the complete scheduling model for three scenarios: without photovoltaic-battery systems, with photovoltaic systems, and with photovoltaic-battery systems. Thirdly, rebound peak generation is restricted by using Multiple Knapsack Problem (MKP) in the proposed algorithm. The presented model reduces the cost of using electricity, alleviates the peak load and peak-valley, mitigates carbon emission, and avoids rebound peaks without posing high discomfort to the consumers. To evaluate the applicability of the proposed framework comparatively with existing frameworks, simulations are conducted. The results show that the proposed HGACO algorithm reduced electricity cost, carbon emission, and peak load by 49.51%, 48.01%, and 25.72% in scenario I; by 55.85%, 54.22%, and 21.69% in scenario II, and by 59.06%, 57.42%, and 17.40% in scenario III, respectively, compared to without scheduling. Thus, the proposed HGACO algorithm-based energy management framework outperforms existing frameworks based on Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, Genetic Algorithm (GA), Hybrid Genetic Particle swarm Optimization (HGPO) algorithm. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Comparing temperature and emissions data does not clearly show a relationship between the two variables. Going further, this study combines Leontief production technology with a computable general equilibrium model of global trade in order to quantitatively test the implications of mitigation policies for welfare and the environment. We compute optimal emissions taxes and show that administering carbon fees reduces environmental damages by nearly 50%. However, there is a tradeoff effect on production which calls for caution when implementing environmental policies. In general, environmental benefits and resources shifting due to carbon taxes lead to welfare gains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The potential of psychological and fiscal framing interventions in motivating environmentally responsible behavior is explored in a context of long distance leisure travel. A series of discrete choice experiments is conducted with 789 participants. Framing conditions like information on CO2 emissions, an injunctive and a descriptive norm, fiscal incentives such as a carbon tax, a bonus-malus and a personal carbon trading scheme are tested while controlling the usual travel price-duration tradeoff. Pricing (including internalization of social cost of CO2 through fiscal incentives) has the expected effect of reducing the choice of travelling and hence CO2 emissions. Providing information on CO2 emissions of each transport alternative significantly reduces preferences for the most emitting modes (air) and favors a less emitting mode (train). Framing the fiscal incentive as personal carbon trading adds a moderate incentive to the price effect in reducing air choice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Spurred by substantial subsidies, renewable energies have reduced their costs and captured a steadily growing market share. However, the variability of solar and wind power leads to new challenges for power systems. Policy instruments for steering the energy transition towards a zero-carbon future must account for this. We consider an economy in which competitive firms use pollutive fossils, intermittent renewables, and storage for electricity production. A Pigouvian tax is still efficient, because price fluctuations that result from intermittent renewables provide sufficient incentives to invest in storage capacities. However, governments have proved reluctant to impose carbon taxes. Therefore, we examine second-best subsidies when carbon pricing is imperfect. The optimal subsidy rate for renewables decreases as electricity production becomes less reliant on fossils. The storage subsidy is usually negative as long as fossils are dispatched while filling the storage, but turns positive thereafter. This is because more storage capacity reduces the price when stored electricity is supplied to the market, but raises it when storage adds to demand. This has countervailing effects on firms’ incentives to invest in fossil capacities. A numerical simulation illustrates that substantial subsidy payments are required even after fossils have been completely driven out of the market. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Along with the gradual understanding of environment protection and sustainable development, government pays attention to the issue of carbon emission. In order to reduce the negative effect of carbon emission in production process on the environment, the government, as a social subject, grants rewards and punishments based on the manufacturers’ carbon emission. The government presents a carbon cap. If the manufacturers’ carbon emission in production is higher than the limit, the government will inflict punishments. On the contrary, if the emission is below this value the incentives were given to motivate the manufacturers′ enthusiasm for reducing the carbon emission. Meanwhile, an enterprise effectively reduces the cost of product by processing and manufacturing waste products in the closed-loop supply chain. Simultaneously, the recycling reduces the pollution to the environment and cuts down the resource consumption which is in accord with the social circumstance protection concept. Consequently, the closed-loop supply chain has received extensive attention of academia. Moreover, this paper considers the limited level of remanufacturing and the cognitive bias of consumers. The unit wholesale price and sales price of reengineering product are lower than the new ones. Thus, the differential pricing has theoretical value and practical significance. The coordination of differential price between new and remanufacturing products’ closed-loop supply chains was studied. Meanwhile, the rewards and punishments on manufacturers′ carbon emission was considered. A coordinate model of differential price closed-loop supply chain was constructed to discuss the selling price of products. An improved revenue sharing contract based on order quantity aims to realize supply chain coordination. By studying the results of centralized, decentralized, and the decentralized models, this paper introduces the improved revenue sharing contract, and combines with the case analysis. The following conclusions were obtained: (1) The improved revenue sharing contract can coordinate the decentralized decision closed-loop supply chain effectively. The introduction of the contract not only increases the quantity of the contract in the decentralized decision model but also cuts down the price, which makes the profit of the supply chain run up to the centralized decision level. (2) In the process of coordinating the supply chain by introducing improved revenue sharing contract, manufacturers and retailers can determine the profit distribution of supply chains by adjusting the parameters. With the increasing of contract parameters in this model, the manufacturer′s profit is decreasing, while the profit of retailer is increasing accordingly. At the same time the scope of parameters was given, in which the coordination of supply chain was achieved, and the manufacturers and retailers were willing to accept the contract. (3) Carbon emission in the production of manufacturer was cut down by implementing the rewards and punishments of government. (4) The profit of supply chain has been reduced after the change trend increases along with the aggrandizing of rewards and punishments of government. (5) When rewards and punishments strength is greater than a certain value, the policy of government can not only reduce carbon emission in the production process but also raise the profit of the supply chain. The government can increase the benefit of environment and ensure economic benefits of the supply chain members by setting reasonable rewards and punishments. © 2019,Journal of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of the firms operating on cross-border or inter-regional platforms that are subject to the enforcement of each local government's carbon emissions regulatory policy, thus causing an imbalance in the sharing of the burden of the greening of the total supply chain. We introduce the concept of equity as the incentive mechanism to coordinate this green supply chain which is a function of the carbon emission permits and the revenue generated by the firms. Due to the complexity and imbalance in the original incentive mechanism to this problem, we provide a new equivalent supply chain network equilibrium model under elastic demand based on user equilibrium theory. We state the user equilibrium conditions and provide the equivalent formulation. We show the trade-offs under various carbon emissions regulatory policies. A product with higher price elasticity and carbon emission intensity not only hampers the firm from gaining a higher revenue, but it also reduces the equity of the system under an invariant emission regulatory policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - We evaluate the benefits of a 'CCS Ready Hub' approach, a regional 'CCS Ready' strategy, which not only includes a number of new coal-fired power plants but also integrates other existing stationary CO2 emissions sources, potential storage sites and potential transportation opportunities into an overarching simulation model. A dynamic top-down simulation model was built based on economic decision criteria and option pricing theory. The model inputs and assumptions build on spatial sampling and analysis using a geographic information system (GIS) approach, engineering assessment of local projects and outputs of a CCS retrofitting investment evaluation through cost cash flow modelling. A case study of Shenzhen city in the Pearl River Delta area in Guangdong in southern China is presented, based on engineering and cost assessment studies and stakeholder consultations and building on existing geological surveys and infrastructure plans. The simulation results show that financing 'CCS Ready' at regional planning level rather than only at the design stage of the individual plant (or project) is preferred since it reduces the overall cost of building integrated CCS systems. On the other hand, we found the value of considering existing stationary CO2 emissions sources in CCS ready design. Therefore, we recommended that making new plants CCS ready or planning a CCS ready hub should consider existing large emissions sources when possible. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The primary return temperature from district heating (DH) connected buildings is in focus for many reasons. A reduced primary return temperature reduces the velocity in the DH pipes which leads to decreased electricity usage for pumps and a higher capacity in the DH-network. The reduction of primary return temperature also influences the heat production units. In order to increase primary energy efficiency it is important to analyse how different DH temperature levels affects the production units. In Sweden DH is the dominating heating source in multi-family housings. With low temperature heating system (such as e.g. floor heating) connected to DH through a heat exchanger (HEX) the primary DH return temperature can be reduced dramatically. These low temperature systems can be introduced as the main heating source in new buildings, or as a complement in buildings when renovating. The benefits for the production units are calculated for a bio-fueled combined heat and power production (CHP) unit. In a CHP station both heat and electric power are produced simultaneously at high efficiency. The amount of heat produced in CHP stations is today over 30% of total heat input to DH in Sweden, and is believed to increase due to electricity pricing and CO2 emissions reduction strategies in the EU. Calculations of the heat and power station are based on an in-house advanced off-design model within the software package IPSEpro. The model is verified with data from a Swedish heat and power station in Enköping. The calculations show how a changed DH temperature is affecting the efficiency of the heat and power station and the electric power-to-heat ratio (α-value).  © 2009 by ABCM.

AB  - In this paper, we use a ten-region model of the world economy to analyze the economic and environmental outcomes that are likely to result from the Paris Climate Agreement. To construct our modeling scenario, we first convert the Agreement's disparate Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledges into equivalent reductions in CO2 emissions relative to a baseline scenario without the Agreement. We then model the Agreement by solving for a CO2 price path in each region that would gradually fulfill the region's NDC pledge by its target date. The resulting paths are quite different across regions, indicating significant differences in marginal abatement costs. We also find that if all regions achieve their NDCs, the Agreement significantly reduces CO2 emissions relative to baseline. However, global emissions would not decline in absolute terms relative to 2015 levels, let alone follow a path consistent with a 2 °C stabilization scenario. We then construct additional scenarios to explore how the outcomes of the Agreement would change if particular countries (the United States, China, and Australia) were to unilaterally withdraw from it without undertaking alternative climate policies. We find that leaving the Agreement raises GDP for the country that leaves, but it also sharply reduces the domestic co-benefits the country receives as a side effect of controlling CO2. For each country we consider, the net effect of withdrawing is negative: the loss of co-benefits exceeds the gain in GDP. That is, we show that when co-benefits are considered, it is in each country's self-interest to remain in the Agreement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The shift from fossil fuels and traditional renewable energy to costlier modern renewable energy based on geothermal wind and solar resources is explained. Statistical data collected from 14 countries with a population greater than 100 million inhabitants was used, where the EU is considered as a country. The period from 1990 to 2015 is covered, however divided in two parts, 1990-2005 when conditions were not favourable for renewable energy because the price of fossil fuels and policy support for renewable energy were low, and 2005-2015 when these conditions improved. Theoretical analyses show that the high price of fossil fuels, policy support and cost-effective technologies can explain the fast growth of modern renewable energy during 2005-2015; however, they only partially account for its slower growth during 1990-2005. An additional explanation might be that the innovators generate qualities due to renewable energy use, which are expressed on the markets as value addition of energy services. The statistical analysis of energy services during 1990-2005 shows that the European Union (EU) led in renewable energy compared to the United States (US), Japan and other countries, which was driven by the social initiatives that fostered new firms in the electricity and gas business. A statistical analysis of energy services in the US and EU during 2005-2015 reveals that their value added has grown on an annual average of 2.0% and 2.8%, respectively, which denotes an annual increase of 3 billion and 6 billion US dollars in the 2005 value (USD2005). This valorisation of energy services has invoked further innovations in distributed energy systems and energy storage. A further statistical analysis of the 14 largest countries by population confirms a valorisation of energy services due to modern renewable energy where the emission reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) is a side-effect. Extrapolation of the average growth rates from the period 1990 to 2015 to the period 2015 to 2040, without any change but a substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy, demonstrates that global income would grow fourfold and energy consumption twofold along with a 100 times larger modern renewable energy and CO2 reduction to 46% of the 2015 level. When those average growth rates of renewable energy decrease linear to 25% in 2040, the global modern renewable energy grows tenfold and CO2 reduces to 82% of the 2015 level. The implication of this statistical study on large countries shows that higher value energy services for households are often based on distributed renewable energy and that such an addition of value generates a CO2 emission reduction as a side effect which can be enhanced by pricing CO2 or obstructed by policy support for the vested interests. This study indicated that the valorisation of energy services will generate a growth of income, energy consumption and renewable energy along with a far-reaching emission reduction of CO2 if policies do foster sustainable innovations. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - From the simulation results of the Energy Modeling Forum's recently completed project on US greenhouse gas emission mitigation policies, this paper estimates and examines welfare effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pricing policies, fuel and technology cost changes, higher electricity demand growth, and limited nuclear generator lifetimes. Eight of the models in the study reported outputs sufficient to estimate damage from CO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and methane, and three of those eight reported outputs sufficient to calculate consumer surplus, supplier profit, government revenue, and therefore total social surplus. Over approximately thirty years, the four CO2 tax policies reduce emissions enough to reduce estimated CO2 damage by $1 to $1.5 trillion, SO2 damage by $1 to $1.3 trillion, and NOX and methane damage by smaller amounts, based on averaging the results from the relevant models. The estimated non-environmental social surplus cost of each of these policies is between 23% and 29% of its environmental benefit. The CO2 cap-and-trade scenario, modeled after the Clean Power Plan, reduces estimated CO2 damage and other emission damage each by $0.4 trillion, at a non-environmental social surplus cost estimated to be 17% of the environmental benefit. Changing the natural gas price changes SO2 damage more than twice as much as it changes CO2 damage. Estimated methane emissions move in the same direction as CO2 emissions in every scenario other than the low natural gas price scenario, in which the methane increase counteracts an estimated 27% of the benefit from the CO2 reduction but only 5% of the total net benefit. In addition, the paper explains the set of assumptions and methods used to estimate environmental damage, and briefly explains how the non-environmental parts of total social surplus can sometimes be computed from more common results if necessary. © 2018

AB  - Soil acidity is a major limiting factor for crop production in many farming systems worldwide. Lime application is the most common practice to mitigate soil acidity. There are complex economic interactions between application of lime and nitrogen fertilizer, with the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the use of these inputs adding further complexity. We employ a non-linear dynamic optimization model to determine economically optimal application strategies for lime and nitrogen fertilizer accounting for the social cost of the resulting emissions of greenhouse gases. The model is applied in three zones with different rainfall levels, in the northern wheatbelt of Western Australia. Rainfall has important influences on results through its effect on the dissolution and leaching of lime, leaching of nitrogen, and the yield potential of crops. Results show that nitrogen-related decisions, such as the type of nitrogen fertilizer and crop rotation, have a substantial impact on optimal lime application rates and resulting emissions. For example, the use of ammonium sulfate, rather than urea, reduces emissions. Similarly, by allowing a reduction in nitrogen fertilizer use the incorporation of legume crops like lupin can reduce emissions by 50%, relative to a wholly non-legume crop rotation. Although carbon pricing reduces emissions, the magnitude of the reductions is modest in all modeled scenarios. The private cost to farmers of a carbon tax in this case study region is small, although the net social benefit of the carbon tax in this case study is smaller still, even without accounting for the transaction costs of operating the tax system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 health crisis, the French government has imposed drastic lockdown measures for a period of 55 days. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO2 emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The circular economy (CE) and the marketing activities are the key subjects to attract the market share in today's complex supply chain. Here, dual selling channels, the online delivery time, and the distributor sales effort are considered as marketing activities to attract the customers. Moreover, in order to meets the economic and environmental principles of the CE, three responsibilities to ease the carbon emission, as approaches for the return on investment, are devised, including investment in the green production, the cap and trade regulation, and the hybrid remanufacturing via both the manufacturer and the distributor under the technology license. This such complex supply chain needs to determine the equilibrium amounts of the distinguishing elements, including the pricing strategy, remanufacturing approaches, delivery time, and sales effort to abate the conflicts between the members, and consequently, to enhance the economic and CE objectives of the supply chain (SC). In order to obtain the equilibrium decision makings, three game theoretical approaches, including the manufacturer-Stackelberg game (SM), the distributor-Stackelberg game (SR) and the Nash game (N) are employed. The interaction between the game sequences and the remanufacturing process is the key purpose of this paper to not only maximize the profit of SC but also to enrich the CE and marketing goals of this research. The outcomes presented that the SM game, where the manufacturer remanufactures most of the defected products which are collected via the distributor, is the best game strategy to improve the profits of both the distributor and the manufacturer, and also to enhance the other distinguishing elements. In addition, in the SR game, when most of the returns remanufacture via the distributor under the manufacturer license, it not only maximizes the profits of members but also lead to the improvement of the distinguishing elements. In the Nash game, however, there is a conflict between the members about the remanufacturing process, which reduces the SC profit in this game as compared to other ones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Advancedd distribution management systems (ADMSs) integrate distributed generation (DG) units and battery energy storage systems (BESSs), and they are a promising solution to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in the energy sector. This study addresses the sustainable ADMS (SADMS) design problem by determining the power flow optimal economic dispatches from traditional power plants, DG units, and BESSs to residential areas while maximizing the total profit. The designed SADMS provides a demand response programs with various energy pricing schemes that correspond to different customers and energy consumption loads. Three carbon emission policies (carbon tax, carbon cap, and carbon trade) are considered in the model. An advancedd two-phase (ATP) approach is proposed to solve the described problem. In the first phase, an artificial neuro-fuzzy system (ANFS) is developed based on self-learning and self-adjusting processes to determine the customer demand response loads and DG unit output energies in uncertain environments. A combined ANFS and optimization solver is proposed in the second phase to determine the optimal SADMS economic dispatch. The application of the proposed approach is examined using an empirical case study in Taiwan. The results demonstrate that the proposed ATP approach can determine the optimal economic dispatch with an extremely small deviation in demand response load of 0.92%. In addition, our approach increases the total profit (improving total profit by approximately 1.1%, 0.8%, and 1.9% for the three different carbon emission policy objective functions) and reduces the computational time (by 3.0–6.0 times) compared to those of the genetic algorithm. Finally, the proposed model illustrates that carbon trade is the best policy for improving the total SADMS profit while satisfying the given environmental constraints. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The issue of global warming has become one of the serious factors affecting sustainable economic development with the dynamics of economic development interact with carbon emissions. The pricing strategy for carbon tax is one of the most feasible methods to achieve the goal of "net zero"in carbon emissions. This paper mainly discusses how the government prices carbon tax without affecting the target profit of the firms. This paper combines the dynamic real options approach (ROA) and the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) to construct an economic model for the government to levy carbon tax. This paper goals the government how to levy carbon tax on industry to accelerate industrial transformation. Assume that the uncertain changes in the growth of the industry are dependent on the carbon tax, and the changes follow the geometric Brownian motion when carbon emissions change, the government imposes different carbon taxes on industry in order to control carbon emissions within a reasonable range. If industry reduces carbon emissions, the government will also reduce carbon tax. The threshold is the upper limit of the government's carbon tax on industry. In order to accelerate the industry investment in innovative clean energy technology and equipment, the threshold provides a reference basis for the government to impose carbon tax on industry and achieve a win-win strategy for economic development and environmental protection. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - China formally launched a national carbon trading market in the power sector in 2017. However, electricity prices in China are still subject to government regulation, which reduces the cost-effectiveness of the carbon pricing policy. This study uses a computable general equilibrium model to explore how China's electricity prices can be deregulated in two stages in the context of implementing carbon pricing in the electricity sector. The results show that under different government policy objectives, the choice of electricity price deregulation is different. If the government intends to significantly reduce marginal abatement costs and promote carbon emission reductions, the electricity price deregulation of non-key electricity consumption sectors should be prioritized in the first stage and that of the national protected sectors in the second stage. Conversely, if the government intends to reduce GDP losses, households' disposable income, and welfare losses effectively, the liberalization of the electricity prices of key electricity consumption sectors should be prioritized in the first stage and that of the household sector in the second stage. Taking 50% of the reduction targets in the electricity sector as an example, if the key electricity consumption sectors and households are prioritized, GDP losses are reduced by 3.6% and 13%, respectively. The results of this study provide new information for China to implement electricity market reform in the context of carbon pricing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - With dwindling nonrenewable energy reserves and the adverse effects of climate change, the development of the smart electricity grid is seen as key to solving global energy security issues and to reducing carbon emissions. In this respect, there is a growing need to integrate renewable (or green) energy sources in the grid. However, the intermittency of these energy sources requires that demand must also be made more responsive to changes in supply, and a number of smart grid technologies are being developed, such as highcapacity batteries and smart meters for the home, to enable consumers to be more responsive to conditions on the grid in real time. Traditional solutions based on these technologies, however, tend to ignore the fact that individual consumers will behave in such a way that best satisfies their own preferences to use or store energy (as opposed to that of the supplier or the grid operator). Hence, in practice, it is unclear how these solutions will cope with large numbers of consumers using their devices in this way. Against this background, in this article, we develop novel control mechanisms based on the use of autonomous agents to better incorporate consumer preferences in managing demand. These agents, residing on consumers' smart meters, can both communicate with the grid and optimize their owner's energy consumption to satisfy their preferences. More specifically, we provide a novel control mechanism that models and controls a system comprising of a green energy supplier operating within the grid and a number of individual homes (each possibly owning a storage device). This control mechanism is based on the concept of homeostasis whereby control signals are sent to individual components of a system, based on their continuous feedback, in order to change their state so that the system may reach a stable equilibrium. Thus, we define a new carbon-based pricing mechanism for this green energy supplier that takes advantage of carbon-intensity signals available on the Internet in order to provide real-time pricing. The pricing scheme is designed in such a way that it can be readily implemented using existing communication technologies and is easily understandable by consumers. Building upon this, we develop new control signals that the supplier can use to incentivize agents to shift demand (using their storage device) to times when green energy is available. Moreover, we show how these signals can be adapted according to changes in supply and to various degrees of penetration of storage in the system.We empirically evaluate our system and show that, when all homes are equipped with storage devices, the supplier can significantly reduce its reliance on other carbon-emitting power sources to cater for its own shortfalls. By so doing, the supplier reduces the carbon emission of the system by up to 25% while the consumer reduces its costs by up to 14.5%. Finally, we demonstrate that our homeostatic control mechanism is not sensitive to small prediction errors and the supplier is incentivized to accurately predict its green production to minimize costs. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - Conventional wisdom holds that, ignoring environmental benefits, carbon taxes should adversely affect low-income countries more than they should affect high-income regions. Simulating various ranges of optimal carbon taxes and testing their impacts, this study draws an opposite conclusion to the above assertion. However, when the model is adjusted to reflect benefits from environmental cleanup, carbon taxes create welfare gains in all regions except for low-income countries. In addition, implementing carbon taxes reduces environmental damages by approximately 50% in absolutely all the six regions considered. Notwithstanding the existence of a tradeoff between welfare and environment for low-income countries implies that energy conservation policies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions would leave people worse-off in these countries. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Increased variability and uncertainty of net electrical load due to high penetration of wind and solar power augments the need for dispatching conventional generators with sufficient ramping capability (RC) needed to balance demand with supply. Having sufficient RC reduces the need of last minute dispatch schedule modifications which cause cost, reliability and environmental outcomes that reduce the benefits of renewables. The Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO), has modified its Unit Commitment and Economic Dispatch algorithms to account for the economic value of provisioning adequate RC levels. This paper explores the outcomes of this modified market-clearing process by simulating 10-minute operations of a scaled MISO test system, for three representative months under low and high wind penetration scenarios. Changes in system performance are quantified by comparing system costs, scarcity events/pricing, energy prices, generation-fuel mix, wind-power curtailment, and CO2 emissions between the conventional market-clearing algorithm and one with flexible RC products. Results indicate that adding RC products lowers CO2 emissions and system costs, facilitates wind integration, and improves reliability. These benefits are robust to changes in the market clearing algorithm parameters such as over/under generation penalties and reserve scarcity prices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Previous analysis of London's congestion charging scheme (CCS) has shown that changes in vehicle speed are an important factor in reducing vehicle emissions. Therefore, a detailed investigation of network average vehicle speed in both central and inner London has been undertaken using a combination of the non-parametric Wilcoxon sign ranks test and a method for calculating the cumulative difference between mean speeds pre- and post-CCS, or cumulative sum (CUSUM) analysis. Within the charging zone (CZ), the Wilcoxon test has shown that the difference in speed between pre- and post-CCS periods has increased on average by 2.1 km h-1 and that these changes are significant at the p=0.05 level. The CUSUM analysis has provided evidence of the timing of this change in mean speed in the CZ and this agrees well with the introduction of the CCS on the 17 February 2003. In combination, these results provide compelling evidence that the introduction of congestion charging has significantly increased vehicle speed in the CZ and by comparison with the results in inner London, that these changes are not part of a wider trend. To examine one impact of this change we used an instantaneous emissions model, the Vehicle Transient Emissions Simulation Software, to undertake a comparison between the change in vehicle emissions associated with changing driving characteristics, between pre- and post-charging periods, and those associated with a change in average speed. The analysis was limited to three vehicle types: a Euro II LGV, a Euro III diesel car and a Euro IV petrol car, but showed that driving characteristics in central London have a relatively small effect on emissions of NOX and CO2 compared with the average vehicle speed. However, for PM 10 emissions from the Euro II LGV the opposite was found and for this vehicle the driving characteristics were more important than the average speed in estimating exhaust emissions. For this vehicle, emissions increased between pre- and post-CCS periods by 4%. For the Euro IV petrol car NOX emissions also increased by 6% between pre- and post-CCS periods. These findings will help to further understand the extent to which congestion charging reduces vehicle emissions in London. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbon pricing policy is one of the most efficient tools to mitigate carbon emission, while it alters the income distribution. The progressive individual income tax system redistributes income and reduces inequality. With a multi-regional dynamic CGE model, this study intends to explore the distributional effect of carbon pricing policy in China and to evaluate how the carbon revenue recycling scheme influences income inequality as well as the redistributive effect of individual income tax. Results show several key findings. First, in order to achieve the national emission peak by 2030, carbon pricing policy will lead to greater income inequality, increasing the after-tax Gini coefficient by 0.59% and 1.88% in 2030 and 2040 respectively. Second, if the carbon pricing revenue is recycled through the individual income tax return, the redistributive effects vary according to the design of the tax return rate. The proportional recycling scheme, i.e. all income groups have the same tax return rate, will continue widening the inequality, while the progressive recycling scheme, i.e. lower income groups have higher tax return rates, will narrow the income gap since 2030. Third, carbon pricing policy with a progressive recycling scheme influences income inequality by means of both reducing distortions of carbon policies on the economy and enhancing the redistributive effects of individual income tax. The carbon pricing policy increases the income inequality because of the domination of a positive economic distortion effect at first, while the carbon pricing policy turns to decrease the income inequality since 2025 because both distortion effect and redistributive effect are negative. © 2021 CUE.

AB  - For the transport sector, promoting carpooling to private car users could be an effective strategy over reducing vehicle kilometers traveled. Theoretical studies have verified that carpooling is not only beneficial to drivers and passengers but also to the environment. Nevertheless, despite carpooling having a huge potential market in car commuters, it is not widely used in practice worldwide. In this paper, we develop a passenger-to-driver matching model based on the characteristics of a private-car based carpooling service, and propose an estimation method for time-based costs as well as the psychological costs of carpooling trips, taking into account the potential motivations and preferences of potential carpoolers. We test the model using commuting data for the Greater London from the UK Census 2011 and travel-time data from Uber. We investigate the service sensitivity to varying carpooling participant rates and fee-sharing ratios with the aim of improving matching performance at least cost. Finally, to illustrate how our matching model might be used, we test some practical carpooling promotion instruments. We found that higher participant role flexibility in the system can improve matching performance significantly. Encouraging commuters to walk helps form more carpooling trips and further reduces carbon emissions. Different fee-sharing ratios can influence matching performance, hence determination of optimal pricing should be based on the specific matching model and its cost parameters. Disincentives like parking charges and congestion charges seem to have a greater effect on carpooling choice than incentives like preferential parking and subsidies. The proposed model and associated findings provide valuable insights for designing an effective matching system and incentive scheme for carpooling services in practice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Closed-Loop Supply Chain (CLSC) has become a critical problem due to its effects on various factors including economic motivations, environmental concerns, and social impacts. Moreover, there are coordination tools, such as pricing and advertising, which impact its performance. In this paper, we offer a two-stage approach to model and solve a sustainable CLSC, taking into account pricing, green quality, and advertising. In the first stage, optimal decisions on pricing, greening, and advertising are made, while in the second stage, a fuzzy multi-objective Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is used to maximize the total profit, reduce CO2 emissions, and improve social impacts. Suitable solution methods are introduced according to the scale of the problem. For small-scale instances, an augmented ϵ-constraint method is used to solve the problem. For large-scale instances, approximations are required, and a Lagrangian relaxation algorithm solves the problem in polynomial time. The performance of the proposed model is evaluated through various numerical examples. The results illustrate the applicability and efficiency of the model, while confirming significant improvements in sustainable objectives under optimal pricing, green quality, and advertising. Besides, the proposed Lagrangian relaxation method significantly reduces the computational time for large-scale instances, with only a 2.308% deviation from the optimal results. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Textbook theory of linking carbon systems suggests linking reduces marginal abatement costs. Contrasting theoretical work and policy analyses suggests that linking, or at least unfettered linking, may not always be beneficial. The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) is unique in that, until 2013, it allowed unlimited use of Kyoto allowances. NZ ETS, thus provides an ideal context to explore the effect of linking and linking restrictions on carbon pricing of small systems. Using data on importation and exportation of allowances, we provide the first empirical analysis of the determinants of allowance prices in the early phase of the NZ ETS. Our results indicate that imports of offsets rather than fundamentals have been the major price determinant. Moreover, the pricing of New Zealand units (NZUs) can be placed into three distinct periods, delineated by two structural breaks. In the first period, the system is largely autarkic; in the second period, as international offset prices drop below the NZU price, the system becomes a “price taker”; in the final period, following policy interventions, the system regains some independence. The case of the NZ ETS shows that small trading systems need to impose, or have the option to impose, quantitative import restriction so as to reap the benefits (lower abatement cost), but not the drawbacks (“importation” of distortions and market integrity issues), of linking. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The presence of consumers able to respond to changes in wholesale electricity prices facilitates the penetration of renewable intermittent sources of energy such as wind or sun power. We investigate how adapting demand to intermittent electricity supply by making consumers price-responsive - thanks to smart meters and home automation appliances - impacts the energy mix. We show that it almost always reduces carbon emissions. Furthermore, when consumers are not too risk-averse, demand response is socially beneficial because the loss from exposing consumers to volatile prices is more than offset by lower production and environmental costs. However, the gain is decreasing when the proportion of reactive consumers increases. Therefore, depending on the costs of the necessary smart hardware, it may be non-optimal to equip the whole population. © 2021

AB  - With increasingly stringent CO2 emission reduction targets, incentives for efficient use of limited biomass resources increase. Technologies for gasification of biomass may then play a key role given their potential for high electrical efficiency and multiple outputs; not only electricity but also bio transport fuels and district heat. The aim of this study is to assess the economic consequences and the potential for CO2 reduction of integration of a biomass gasification plant into a district-heating (DH) system. The study focuses on co-location with an existing natural gas combined cycle heat and power plant in the municipal DH system of Göteborg, Sweden. The analysis is carried out using a systems modelling approach. The so-called MARTES model is used. MARTES is a simulating, DH systems supply model with a detailed time slice division. The economic robustness of different solutions is investigated by using different sets of parameters for electricity price, fuel prices and policy tools. In this study, it is assumed that not only tradable green certificates for electricity but also tradable green certificates for transport fuels exist. The economic results show strong dependence on the technical solutions and scenario assumptions but in most cases a stand-alone SNG-polygeneration plant with district-heat delivery is the cost-optimal solution. Its profitability is strongly dependent on policy tools and the price relation between biomass and fossil fuels. Finally, the results show that operation of the biomass gasification plants reduces the (DH) system's net emissions of CO2. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Carbon capture and storage (CCS) does not generate energy. CCS applied to fossil and modern bio-carbon fuels and feedstocks removes environmentally damaging CO2 emissions. CoP21 stipulated a maximum 2°C-1.5°C global warming from 2050 in perpetuity. Both CCS and negative emission technology (NET) are now required to manage the carbon stock in earth's atmosphere and oceans. All components of CCS are operationally proven secure at the industrial scale. Fifteen CCS projects operate globally; seven are under construction. CCS systems increase electricity prices, to about £100/MWhr. CCS on industry is cheaper and storage costs minimal (£5-20/tonne). CCS reduces whole economy costs of carbon transition by 2.5 times. Policies of capex subsidy, oversupplied emissions certificates, weak carbon pricing, and weak emissions standards have all failed to develop large cost CCS mega-projects. New carbon certificates could link the extraction of carbon to an obligation to store a percentage of emissions. Certificates connect CCS and NET pathways to secure carbon storage for the public good. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

AB  - Australia's carbon pricing scheme protects the profits of polluters and, as a consequence, has a negligible impact on the carbon emissions emanating from Australian industries. I concentrate on the assistance given to emissions-intensive, tradeexposed industries and use a post Keynesian approach to explain that, despite the rhetoric, industries and firms will not move offshore under a carbon price and industry assistance is unnecessary. When assistance is given, profits are protected and could increase in certain industries, which occurred in the comparable European emissions trading scheme. In orthodox economic theory, despite this negligible impact on profits, any method of pricing carbon causes a reduction in emissions because firms seek to adjust technology and factor inputs at the margin and abate until marginal abatement costs equal the carbon price. However, from a post Keynesian perspective, the government's prediction of a transformed economy and clean energy future will not occur unless the carbon pricing policy reduces the corporate profits of emitting firms. Thus, complementary policies are required to take the burden of reducing emissions off the more symbolic carbon market established. I further argue that a carbon tax without any industry assistance is a preferred approach and that where plant shutdown does occur, carbon emissions around the world will fall and workers could be compensated at a far smaller cost than the adjustment assistance given to industries in the policy's current form.

AB  - The advancement of the smart grids (SGs) is enabling consumers to schedule home appliances to respond to demand response programs (DRs) offered by distribution system operators (DSOs). This way, not only will customers save money on their energy bills and be more comfortable, but the utility company will also be able to regulate peak-hour demand and reduce carbon emissions (CE). Designing an optimization scheme to reduce the electricity bill cost, peak-to-average ratio (PAR), CO2emission, wait time, and enhance the user comfort in terms of delay, luminance, and thermal comfort is not only the aim of this work but also the need of demand-side management. This research focuses on energy usage, scheduling, and management under the DR program of an electric utility, as well as renewable energy sources integration, i.e., solar energy (SE), thermal, controllable heat and power (CHP), and wind energy (WE). Moreover, the integration of renewable energy sources will reduce electricity bills and also lower the environmental impact of CE. In this context, a smart appliances scheduler and energy management controller (ASEMC) is proposed, which is based on heuristic algorithms, i.e., genetic algorithm (GA), wind-driven optimization (WDO), particle swarm optimization (PSO), bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) and our proposed hybrid of GA, PSO, and WDO (HGPDO) algorithm. The performance of the proposed scheme and heuristic algorithms is evaluated via simulations. Results show that in Scenario 1, the proposed algorithm-based ASEMC reduces the electricity bill costs, PAR, and CE by 25.7%, 36.39%, and 20.74%, respectively. In contrast, in Scenario 2, the proposed algorithm-based ASEMC reduces the electricity bill costs, PAR, and CE by 35.25%, 31.72%, and 36.30%, respectively. Furthermore, in Scenario 1, user comfort in terms of cumulative delay, indoor air freshness quality, thermal, and visual comfort improves by 26.77%, 3.28%, 13.33%, and 31.66%, whereas in Scenario 2, user comfort improves by 23.33%, 3.30%, 10%, and 45%, respectively. © 2021 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

AB  - This paper calculates, for the top 20 emitting countries, how much pricing of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions would be in their own national interests due to domestic co-benefits (leaving aside the global climate benefits). On average, second-best domestic prices are substantial, 57.5 per ton of CO2 (for year 2010), reflecting primarily health co-benefits from reduced air pollution at coal plants and, in some cases, reductions in automobile externalities net of fuel taxes/subsidies. Pricing co-benefits reduces CO2 emissions from the top 20 emitters by 13.5%. However, co-benefits vary dramatically across countries (e.g., with population exposure to pollution) and differentiated pricing of CO2 emissions therefore yields higher net benefits (by 23%) than uniform pricing. Importantly, the efficiency case for pricing carbon's co-benefits hinges critically on weak prospects (for the foreseeable future) for comprehensive internalization of other externalities through other (more efficient) pricing instruments. © 2015 World Scientific Publishing Company.

AB  - Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) will play a key role in the extension of the smart grid towards residential premises, and enable various demand and energy management applications. Efficient demand-supply balance and reducing electricity expenses and carbon emissions will be the immediate benefits of these applications. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of an in-home energy management (iHEM) application. The performance of iHEM is compared with an optimization-based residential energy management (OREM) scheme whose objective is to minimize the energy expenses of the consumers. We show that iHEM decreases energy expenses, reduces the contribution of the consumers to the peak load, reduces the carbon emissions of the household, and its savings are close to OREM. On the other hand, iHEM application is more flexible as it allows communication between the controller and the consumer utilizing the wireless sensor home area network (WSHAN). We evaluate the performance of iHEM under the presence of local energy generation capability, prioritized appliances, and for real-time pricing. We show that iHEM reduces the expenses of the consumers for each case. Furthermore, we show that packet delivery ratio, delay, and jitter of the WSHAN improve as the packet size of the monitoring applications, that also utilize the WSHAN, decreases. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - The paper examines the possible interactions of various policy proposals to introduce carbon taxation, adjust the domestic price of gas to export parity and build a major electricity interconnector, and their impact on carbon emissions and the fuel mix of the Russian electricity supply industry. Without raising gas prices, a carbon tax of ∈25/tonne CO2 reduces emissions by 13% and the output of coal-fired plant by nearly 50%, with the major impact at ∈6.3-12.5/tonne. Moving gas prices to export parity substantially offsets this effect, and requires higher carbon taxes to reduce emissions by the same amount, as does building the prospective interconnector "Ural-Siberia".

AB  - Several studies have examined the impact of economic growth on carbon emission; however, the symmetric and asymmetric impact of oil price along with FDI on carbon emission has not studied in the case of Pakistan. For this purpose, the long and short-run impact of per capita income, FDI, and oil price on carbon emissions investigated by employing the ARDL and non-linear ARDL cointegration methodology, along with Granger causality in the context of Pakistan for 1971–2014. This study confirms the EKC hypothesis for Pakistan under both methodologies, whereas symmetric results show that economic growth and FDI intensify carbon emission in both the long and short-run, while oil price increase emission in the short-run and reduces emission in the long-run. Whereas asymmetric results in the long-run show that an increase in oil price reduces emissions and decrease in oil price intensify emissions. The causality analysis also supports the above findings and suggests a feedback effect between economic growth and carbon emission in Pakistan. This study provides implications for policymakers, where the descending flow of FDI allows limited space to Pakistan in FDI selection; however, the presence of emission convergence and adoption of carbon pricing may facilitate Pakistan in achieving its environmental targets. While diversifying the overall energy mix towards more renewable/clean energy along with formulating favorable policies for the adoption of renewable energy like solar by the industrial and residential consumers can further reduce the overall emission levels. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This study investigates the potential cost and emissions reductions that result from an increase in electricity transmission capacity between Canada's two westernmost provinces: Alberta, a fossil fuel dominated jurisdiction, and British Columbia, a predominantly hydroelectric jurisdiction. A bottom-up model is used to find the least cost electricity generation mix in Alberta and British Columbia under different carbon policies. The long-term evolution of the electricity system is determined by minimizing net present cost of electricity generation for the time span of 2010–2060. Different levels of intertie capacity expansion are considered together with a variety of carbon tax and carbon cap scenarios. Results indicate that increased intertie capacity reduces the cost of electricity and emissions under carbon pricing policies. However, the expandable intertie does not encourage greater adoption of variable renewable generation. Instead, it is used to move low-cost energy from the United States to Alberta. The optimal intertie capacity and cost reduction of increased interconnectivity increases with more restrictive carbon policies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper employs a novel Monte-Carlo based generation portfolio assessment tool to explore the implications of increasing wind penetration and carbon prices within future electricity generation portfolios under considerable uncertainty. This tool combines optimal generation mix techniques with Monte Carlo simulation and portfolio analysis methods to determine expected overall generation costs, associated cost uncertainty and expected CO2 emissions for different possible generation portfolios. A case study of an electricity industry with coal, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT), Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT) and wind generation options that faces uncertain future fossil-fuel prices, carbon pricing, electricity demand and plant construction costs is presented to illustrate some of the key issues associated with growing wind penetrations. The case study uses half-hourly demand and wind generation data from South Eastern Australia, and regional estimates of new-build plant costs and characteristics. Results suggest that although wind generation generally increases overall industry costs, it reduces associated cost uncertainties and CO2 emissions. However, there are some cases in which wind generation can reduce the overall costs of generation portfolios. The extent to which wind penetration affects industry expected costs and uncertainties depends on the level of carbon price and the conventional technology mix in the portfolios. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - We contribute to the growing literature on how political support for domestic policies that contribute to global collective goods is impacted by other countries’ policy actions. To do so, we focus on carbon taxation, one of the most important yet contested policy instruments for mitigating global warming, in the world’s third largest economy, Japan. Using a combination of two experiments embedded in a representative public opinion survey, we examine arguments relating to how the adoption and level of ambition of other countries’ carbon taxes affect the public’s preferences for current and future carbon tax designs. We find evidence that the choices of other countries affect both support for carbon taxation and preferences over its design. More ambitious carbon pricing in other countries increases support for carbon taxation, while less ambitious pricing reduces support. Moreover, information about lower carbon prices in other countries decreases support more than other countries having no carbon taxation at all. Public support for more stringent domestic carbon pricing thus hinges on the policy choices of other countries, contrary to other environmental issues. Our research also shows, however, that particular domestic policy design choices can help in mitigating otherwise negative effects of non-cooperative behavior by other countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Promoting green innovation and regulating emissions through carbon pricing are the two fundamental driving forces of climate change policies on carbon abatement. However, the existing body of empirical evidence focusing on these inter-linkages is rather meager. Such evidence is also inconclusive in the context of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)countries. This study, therefore, examines the effects of environmental regulation and innovation on the carbon emission reduction of OECD countries during the period 1999–2014. On the basis of the “stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology” (STIRPAT)model, this study also develops a new model called “stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, regulation, and technology” (STIRPART)to extend the analysis on the evaluation of factors influencing carbon emissions. In addition, the effects of environmental regulations and environmentally friendly technologies are empirically tested by using panel fixed-effects, random-effects and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM)models with the Driscoll–Kraay corrected robust standard errors that tackle cross-sectional dependence and time and panel fixed effects. Results indicate that a 1% increase in environmentally friendly patent reduces carbon emissions by 0.017%, and a 1% increase in environmental tax revenue per capita reduces carbon emissions by 0.03% for OECD countries. The current contribution aims to optimize market-based instruments, such as patents and carbon pricing, for the implementation of efficient and cost-effective climate change policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Using a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, this paper investigates the impact of carbon regulations on the Japanese economy. We use an 11-sector, 15-region global dynamic CGE model with a time span from 2011 to 2050. We assume that Japan (along with other developed regions) reduces CO2 emissions by 80% by 2050 and analyze the impact on the Japanese economy. In particular, we consider multiple scenarios of CO2 reduction rates in less developed regions and analyze how changes in CO2 reduction in these regions affect Japan. In addition, we also consider multiple scenarios of the use of a border adjustment policy and analyze its impact. Our simulation results are summarized as follows. First, an 80% CO2 reduction in Japan generates large negative impacts on the Japanese economy in terms of both the macroeconomy and individual sectors. Second, changes in the reduction rates in less developed regions have only a small impact on Japan. Third, the use of border adjustment in Japan has a small impact on the GDP and welfare of Japan overall but a large impact on output in the energy intensive sectors. When future climate change policies in Japan are discussed, much attention is usually paid to climate policy in less developed regions. However, the second result of our analysis suggests that climate change policy in less developed regions has only a small impact on Japan. In addition, the third result indicates that the effectiveness of border adjustment is limited. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Reducing the carbon footprint of energy generation is an important part of ongoing sustainability efforts. To cut carbon footprints, electric utilities are incentivizing renewable energy integration through net metering and introducing time-of-use pricing plans to cut demand peaks, as peaks significantly contribute to both generation costs and carbon emissions. Net metering is one of the most popular means of integrating distributed renewable generation in the grid. However, the current net metering approach doesn't effectively cut demand peaks because renewable harvest peak and demand peaks are out of sync. Furthermore, as several states impose net metering subscriber limits of less than 1% of the peak, net metering isn't even close to realizing the full potential of renewable integration in the grid. To address these limitations, we present GreenPeaks, an energy storage based renewable integration system to enhance net metering. GreenPeaks employs energy storage to intelligently move a fraction of harvested energy to peak intervals and accumulate any surplus harvest. We evaluate GreenPeaks using consumption data from real homes. Our results show that GreenPeaks reduces grid-wide peak by 12% in contrast to net metering's 2%, while reducing the electricity generation costs by more than 40%. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) are considered to be a potentially sustainable alternative to conventional vehicles for private transport and a way of balancing intermittent generation from renewable energy sources (RES). Using RES for electric mobility would be superior to all available fossil generation alternatives in terms of emissions and efficient energy conversion. To quantify the marginal energy from RES used, two charging strategies last trip charging and optimized demand-side management (DSM) with dynamic pricing are investigated for a German long-term high RES power mix scenario. The results for both charging cases indicate that the power demand for PEVs will not be met by RES. For last trip charging 1.40% comes from RES. In terms of DSM this share increases to 7.38% but results in higher overall CO2 emissions because for Germany coal provides the lowest cost fossil power. Hence DSM charging reduces peak load and helps to balance RES generation but is contrary to the original idea of clean transportation because of higher marginal emissions caused by the utilisation of coal. To account for contractual arrangements allowing consumers to directly purchase RES electricity, a second scenario with additional installed RES capacity is analysed. Because of the high RES share of over 50 % a complete usage of the RES is not possible and a small fraction of power must still be provided by dispatchable power plants. For the second scenario, DSM charging also allows for an increased use of RES compared to last trip charging (99 % versus 90% RES). In addition, total marginal CO2 emissions are lower and DSM helps to balance the ramping of RES. Therefore, it is concluded that for Germany the installation of additional RES and DSM charging would guarantee clean transportation using electric vehicles. © 2012 WEVA.

AB  - Global warming has become an issue of increasing worldwide concern. At present, the most direct way to solve this problem is to control carbon emissions. In our paper, carbon tax policy is injected into a two-stage supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and two retailers. We establish six game models according to the relationship (competitive or cooperative) between the retailers and three power structures (manufacturer Stackelberg (MS), retailer Stackelberg (RS), and vertical Nash (VN)) between the two retailers and the manufacturer. We then adopt the inverse induction method to derive optimal pricing decisions for each model. Optimal profits for supply chain members are obtained. Finally, we analyse: i) the effects of competition and cooperation between the two retailers on equilibrium results; ii) the effects of the three possible power structures existing between the manufacturer and the two retailers on equilibrium results; and especially iii) the effect of the carbon tax rate on pricing decision and the profits of the supply chain. We find that the different power structure and the horizontal relationship between the two retailers have important influence on equilibrium results. Further, the change of carbon tax rate have different influence on pricing under the different power structure and the horizontal relationship between the two retailers. When the government adjusts the carbon tax rate, it should fully consider the different power structure and the horizontal relationship for two-stage supply chain consisting of one manufacturer and two retailers. Although the implementation of the carbon tax policy reduces the corporate profits, it reduces the total carbon emission. The carbon tax policy is helpful to build an environment-friendly and resource-conserving society. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - It is important to evaluate impacts of fossil fuel price hikes and climate stabilization that force the global energy system to adopt alternative and efficient technologies by routing future energy system dynamics into a different technology roadmap. Hence, a high-regional-resolution and technology-rich DNE21+ model is used for the simulation of some price-hike scenarios for the period from 2000 to 2030 by increasing the ordinate of cost-potential curve of crude oil, natural gas and coal by 55 US$(00)/bbl, 3.8 US$(00)/kcf and 56 US$(00)/tonne, respectively, above their reference values; and 550 ppmv stabilization is implemented by carbon limitation from 6998 to 8250 MtC/yr. This study detected that hike in fossil fuel prices acts as an anti-catalyst for human-induced anthropogenic emissions and alleviates heavy dependency upon fossil fuels. Further, it partially solves problems of climate change by reducing CO2 emission levels (23%), reflects human behavior through energy conservation (1.4 Gtoe), calls for efficiency improvement (7%), adopts more efficient and alternative technologies, compared to reference; however, with 550 ppmv stabilization, energy conservation rises to 1.6 Gtoe, demands 16% higher efficiency improvement and reduces CO2 emission by 36%, relative to reference.

AB  - China is currently attempting to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase natural gas consumption as a part of broader national strategies to reduce the air pollution impacts of the nation's energy system. To assess the scenarios of natural gas development up to 2050, we employ a global energy-economic model-the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model. The results show that a cap-and-trade policy will enable China to achieve its climate mitigation goals, but will also reduce natural gas consumption. An integrated policy that uses a part of the carbon revenue obtained from the cap-and-trade system to subsidize natural gas use promotes natural gas consumption, resulting in a further reduction in coal use relative to the cap-and-trade policy case. The integrated policy has a very moderate welfare cost; however, it reduces air pollution and allows China to achieve both the climate objective and the natural gas promotion objective. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Can near-term public support of renewable energy technologies contain the increase of mitigation costs due to delays of implementing emission caps at the global level? To answer this question we design a set of first and second best scenarios to analyze the impact of early deployment of renewable energy technologies on welfare and emission timing to achieve atmospheric carbon stabilization by 2100. We use the global multiregional energy-economy-climate hybrid model REMIND-R as a tool for this analysis. An important design feature of the policy scenarios is the timing of climate policy. Immediate climate policy contains the mitigation costs at less than 1% even if the CO 2 concentration target is 410 ppm by 2100. Delayed climate policy increases the costs significantly because the absence of a strong carbon price signal continues the carbon intensive growth path. The additional costs can be decreased by early technology policies supporting renewable energy technologies because emissions grow less, alternative energy technologies are increased in capacity and their costs are reduced through learning by doing. The effects of early technology policy are different in scenarios with immediate carbon pricing. In the case of delayed climate policy, the emission path can be brought closer to the first-best solution, whereas in the case of immediate climate policy additional technology policy would lead to deviations from the optimal emission path. Hence, technology policy in the delayed climate policy case reduces costs, but in the case of immediate climate policy they increase. However, the near-term emission reductions are smaller in the case of delayed climate policies. At the regional level the effects on mitigation costs are heterogeneously distributed. For the USA and Europe early technology policy has a positive welfare effect for immediate and delayed climate policies. In contrast, India looses in both cases. China loses in the case of immediate climate policy, but profits in the delayed case. Early support of renewable energy technologies devalues the stock of emission allowances, and this effect is considerable for delayed climate policies. In combination with the initial allocation rule of contraction and convergence a relatively well-endowed country like India loses and potential importers like the EU gain from early renewable deployment. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Carbon pricing policy is one of the most efficient tools to mitigate carbon emissions. However, additional carbon cost alters the production behavior and sectoral development, thus leading to income redistribution and regional disparity. Revenue recycling schemes use the carbon pricing revenue to reduce preexisting revenuemotivated taxes. This paper intends to evaluate the effect on income inequality and regional disparity of carbon pricing policy with different revenue recycling schemes. This study adopts the China Hybrid Energy and Economic Research (CHEER) model, a dynamic CGE model, and extends it to the CHEER-Plato model in order to better study the effects of the carbon pricing policy and the revenue recycling schemes. Results show several key findings. First, carbon pricing policy without recycling the revenue will lead to greater income inequality, increasing the national Theil index by 0.87% and 3.61% in 2030 and 2040 respectively. The inter-provincial disparity will raise obviously by 3.97% and 12.72%, while the inner-provincial inequality will change slightly. Second, recycling carbon pricing revenue through individual income tax return reduces income inequality. Compared with policy without recycling schemes, returning the revenue with progressive tax return rates by labor income groups, reduces the Theil index by 2.53% and 7.88% in 2030 and 2040, while the scheme with region-specified return rate by 1.42% and 4.42%, and the scheme with uniform return rate by only 0.43% and 1.23%. Third, carbon pricing policy reduces the inequality in Shanxi and Inner Mongolia by more than 2% and revenue recycling scheme with progressive tax return rates by labor income groups further narrows the income gap in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Xinjiang by over 3% in 2030. © 2021 ICAE.

AB  - The main purpose of demand side management (DSM) is to reduce peak load demand, overall cost and carbon dioxide emissions to improve the sustainability of the grid. This paper proposes the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm combines the smart plug to control the appliances for the purpose of load shifting in the DSM system. The proposed PSO load shifting method calculates the power consumption by hours with the following procedure: shifting part of the power to the off-peak demand period, making the electrical load balanced, finding the lowest cost and optimal switching period of the appliance, and then output to the smart plug through Wi-Fi to control the appliances. The experimental results show that the proposed PSO load shifting method in the two-stage time-of-use (TOU), the average power cost decreases by 51% and 18%, and the peak-to-average ratio (PAR) declines by 7.4% and 36%, respectively in summer month and non-summer month. In addition, in the three-stage TOU, the average power cost reduces by 50% and 23%, and the PAR increases by 7.9% and declines by 35%, respectively in summer month and non-summer month. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Forest carbon sequestration offsets are methodologically uncertain, comprise a minor component of carbon markets and do not effectively slow deforestation. The objective of this study is to describe a commercial scale in situ measurement approach for determination of net forest carbon sequestration projects, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM, to address forest carbon market uncertainties. In contrast to protocols that rely on limited forest mensuration, growth simulation and exclusion of CO2 data, the Direct Measurement Forest Carbon ProtocolTM is based on standardized methods for direct determination of net ecosystem exchange (NEE) of CO2 employing eddy covariance, a meteorological approach integrating forest carbon fluxes. NEE is used here as the basis for quantifying the first of its kind carbon financial products. The DMFCP differentiates physical, project and financial carbon within a System-of-SystemsTM (SoS) network architecture. SoS sensor nodes, the Global Monitoring PlatformTM (GMP), housing analyzers for CO2 isotopologues (e.g., 12CO2,13CO214CO2) and greenhouse gases are deployed across the project landscape. The SoS standardizes and automates GMP measurement, uncertainty and reporting functions creating diverse forest carbon portfolios while reducing cost and investment risk in alignment with modern portfolio theory. To illustrate SoS field deployment and operation, published annual NEE data for a tropical (Ankasa Park, Ghana, Africa) and a deciduous forest (Harvard Forest, Petersham, MA, USA) are used to forecast carbon revenue. Carbon pricing scenarios are combined with historical in situ NEE annual time-series to extrapolate pre-tax revenue for each project applied to 100,000 acres (40,469 hectares) of surrounding land. Based on carbon pricing of $5 to $36 per ton CO2 equivalent (tCO2eq) and observed NEE sequestration rates of 0.48 to 15.60 tCO2eq acre−1 yr−1, pre-tax cash flows ranging from $230,000 to $16,380,000 across project time-series are calculated, up to 5× revenue for contemporary voluntary offsets, demonstrating new economic incentives to reverse deforestation. The SoS concept of operation and architecture, with engineering development, can be extended to diverse gas species across terrestrial, aquatic and oceanic ecosystems, harmonizing voluntary and compliance market products worldwide to assist in the management of global warming. The Direct Measurement Forest Carbon Protocol reduces risk of invalidation intrinsic to estimation-based protocols such as the Climate Action Reserve and the Clean Development Mechanism that do not observe molecular CO2 to calibrate financial products. Multinational policy applications such as the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation, constrained by Kyoto Protocol era processes, will benefit from NEE measurement avoiding unsupported claims of emission reduction, fraud, and forest conservation policy failure.

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to investigate the effects of some mainstream policy schemes in the power sector on the reduction of CO2 emissions. The first part of this chapter is the analysis on the effects of promoting generation (fuel) efficiency of fossil-fuel power generation, specifically assuming more efficient coal-fired power plants that recently indicates increased presence in the Japanese power sector. Improvement in generation efficiency of fossil-fuel power plants is expected to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide mainly from a technological aspect. However, overall effects on carbon reduction in the whole industry would be ambiguous since it also depends on market structure. The increased efficiency in generation leads to an improvement in cost conditions of fossil-fuel power producers relative to their rivals. It enables them to expand their generation and market share. Analyzing the Cournot oligopoly model, it is shown that an improvement in fossil-fuel power generations produces two effects: the ‘saving effect’ and the ‘rebound effect’. The total CO2 emission in the whole industry decrease if the former effect exceeds the other, and vice versa. In addition, it is indicated that a rise in the generation efficiency would increase a difficulty of implementing carbon tax. In the second part of this chapter, I study the combination of feed-in tariff and carbon tax; that would be worthy to investigate since they could possibly complement each other. FIT policy could be financed by the revenue of carbon tax, and a reduction in electricity supply by the carbon tax would be lessen by supporting renewable power generations under FIT. It is demonstrated that FIT had the combined effects: it fosters a competitive environment in addition to indirectly reduces CO2 emissions. The result indicates that the combination of these policies would produce potential welfare gains. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - A significant proportion of total worldwide energy is consumed by buildings. For example, buildings in the US account for about 40 percent of total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Making buildings more energy-efficient is an important step to reduce our energy consumption and carbon emission in the combat with global climate change. Broad participation by consumers, business owners, and governments is required to continuously improve on energy efficiency for new and existing buildings and to achieve the global greenhouse gas emission reduction objectives. This paper provides a software system perspective of improving energy efficiency for buildings. It proposes an architecture that allows for phased investments in technologies to capture the returns from energy savings in various use cases. In addition, it addresses the needs and objectives of different stakeholders, including owners, operators, users, and utility providers. A proof-of-concept implementation of the architecture is used to demonstrate the support for building-wide energy conservation policies using real-time energy pricing and individual occupants' locations and preferences. It shows that the proposed architecture enables fine-grained building control and reduces energy consumption while maximizing its occupants' comfort. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - We propose an emission-oriented charging scheme to evaluate the emissions of electric vehicle (EV) charging from the electricity sector at the region of Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT). We investigate both day- and night-charging scenarios combined with realistic system load demand under the emission-oriented vs direct charging schemes. Our emission-oriented charging scheme reduces carbon emissions in the day by 13.8 % on average. We also find that emission-oriented charging results in a significant CO2 reduction in 30% of the days in a year compared with direct charging. Apart from offering a flat rebate for EV owners, our analysis reveals that certain policy incentives (e.g. pricing) regarding EV charging should be taken into account in order to reflect the benefits of emissions reduction that haven't been incorporated in the current market of electricity transactions. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - This study examines the use of water-use fees in California's bidding-based power markets to balance freshwater conservation and reduction of the marine ecosystem impact of coastal once-through-cooled power plants. An hourly power dispatch is simulated using the state's 2014 demand and generation capacity data. Fees on ocean water withdrawals of $5–120/acre-ft are simulated in three scenarios that test the grid's ability to simultaneously mitigate its impact on marine ecosystems, conserve freshwater, and incentivize recycled water use. Although fees modeled represent a small share of generator fuel costs, results show that they trigger declines in ocean water withdrawals of up to 11% that are almost always cost-effective if accounting for effects on system-wide fuel costs and CO2 emissions. An appropriately designed fee-structure reduces ocean water withdrawals by 9% without increasing freshwater consumption elsewhere. Wholesale electricity price increases of 5–10% are concentrated in Northern California, and marine ecosystem benefits are partly offset by increases in NOx and SO2 emissions inland. Overall, this study finds that water-use fees could be an effective strategy for reducing the marine ecosystem impacts of California's power sector, particularly because they can also address short term fluctuations in freshwater scarcity.

AB  - Cost degression in photovoltaics, wind-power and battery storage has been faster than previously anticipated. In the future, climate policy to limit global warming to 1.5–2 °C will make carbon-based fuels increasingly scarce and expensive. Here we show that further progress in solar- and wind-power technology along with carbon pricing to reach the Paris Climate targets could make electricity cheaper than carbon-based fuels. In combination with demand-side innovation, for instance in e-mobility and heat pumps, this is likely to induce a fundamental transformation of energy systems towards a dominance of electricity-based end uses. In a 1.5 °C scenario with limited availability of bioenergy and carbon dioxide removal, electricity could account for 66% of final energy by mid-century, three times the current levels and substantially higher than in previous climate policy scenarios assessed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The lower production of bioenergy in our high-electrification scenarios markedly reduces energy-related land and water requirements. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.

AB  - Fiscal considerations may shift governmental priorities away from environmental concerns: finance ministers face strong demand for public expenditures such as infrastructure investments but they are constrained by international tax competition. We develop a multi-region model of tax competition and resource extraction to assess the fiscal incentive of imposing a tax on carbon rather than on capital. We explicitly model international capital and resource markets, as well as intertemporal capital accumulation and resource extraction. While fossil resources give rise to scarcity rents, capital does not. With carbon taxes, the rents can be captured and invested in infrastructure, which leads to higher welfare than under capital taxation. This result holds even without modeling environmental damages. It is robust under a variation of the behavioral assumptions of resource importers to coordinate their actions, and a resource exporter’s ability to counteract carbon policies. Further, no green paradox occurs—instead, the carbon tax constitutes a viable green policy, since it postpones extraction and reduces cumulative emissions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Plug-in electric vehicles (PEV) are considered to be a potentially sustainable alternative to conventional vehicles for private transport and a way of balancing intermittent generation from renewable energy sources (RES). Using RES for electric mobility would be superior to all available fossil generation alternatives in terms of emissions and efficient energy conversion. To quantify the marginal energy from RES used, two charging strategies last trip charging and optimized demand-side management (DSM) with dynamic pricing are investigated for a German long-term high RES power mix scenario. The results for both charging cases indicate that the power demand for PEVs will not be met by RES. For last trip charging 1.40% comes from RES. In terms of DSM this share increases to 7.38% but results in higher overall CO2 emissions because for Germany coal provides the lowest cost fossil power. Hence DSM charging reduces peak load and helps to balance RES generation but is contrary to the original idea of clean transportation because of higher marginal emissions caused by the utilisation of coal. To account for contractual arrangements allowing consumers to directly purchase RES electricity, a second scenario with additional installed RES capacity is analysed. Because of the high RES share of over 50 % a complete usage of the RES is not possible and a small fraction of power must still be provided by dispatchable power plants. For the second scenario, DSM charging also allows for an increased use of RES compared to last trip charging (99 % versus 90% RES). In addition, total marginal CO 2 emissions are lower and DSM helps to balance the ramping of RES. Therefore, it is concluded that for Gennany the installation of additional RES and DSM charging would guarantee clean transportation using electric vehicles.
