AB  - A matter of debate in climate policy is whether lawmakers should rely on carbon pricing or regulations, such as low-carbon standards, to reach emission reduction goals. Past research showed that pricing is more cost-effective. However, previous work studied the two policies when implemented separately, in effect comparing two policy extremes. In contrast, we explore the full spectrum of climate policy mixes that include both types of policies but vary in how much they rely on each. We do this both analytically by extending previous theory and numerically with two energy system models. In line with past work, increasing reliance on pricing increases the cost-effectiveness of the policy mix. However, we show that this benefit exhibits diminishing marginal returns. Thus the gain in cost-effectiveness from complementing stringent standards with modest pricing is relatively large. Our results show that relying on pricing for 20% of emission reductions (and on a standard for 80%) reduces costs by 32%–57% compared to a standard-only approach. Importantly, trading off more of the standard for pricing delivers smaller and smaller gains in cost-effectiveness. For example, a policy mix that relies on each policy for 50% of emission reductions decreases costs by 60%–81%, which is already 71%–88% as cost-effective as the theoretically most cost-effective pricing-only policy. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The human food supply chain is significantly influenced by growing items (GIs) like beef, sheep, hog, chicken, turkey, and other species, as these provide major contributions to food security worldwide. Industrial farming businesses carry out their operations by purchasing a certain species of baby GIs from a supplier, feeding and caring for them until they reach an acceptable living weight, and then selling them after they have been slaughtered and processed. In addition, the production of livestock worldwide accounts for 14.5% of all anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), making it a substantial contributor to GHG emissions. Thereby, to regulate emissions, governments from several countries have imposed a tax scheme on the farm's emission volume. Due to the discrete nature of purchase numbers, using a differentiation-based optimization approach is not appropriate for determining the optimal GI procurement for an industrial farm, making the decision significantly more challenging. The primary goal of this study is to identify the optimal number of GIs for a farm to enhance financial and environmental performance when the cost per weight unit of procurement depends on the volume of purchases and the consumption of processed commodities follows a power demand pattern. A comparison tactic is employed only for the discrete decision variable, while the classical optimization tactic, based on differentiation, is adopted for the remaining continuous decision variable of the derived problem. Our method, which is quite straightforward in its operation, enables the creation of a rule to distinguish between instances in which there is only one optimum solution and those in which there are two. The results from the execution of the novel solution technique reveal that the farm reduces the overall cost of the order while keeping the integrality of the purchased GIs by taking into account the regulation for carbon emissions, the discount, and the power demand pattern. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Policymakers face the challenge of integrating intermittent output from variable renewable energy (VRE). Even in a well-functioning power sector with flexible generation, producers’ incentives may not align with society's welfare-maximisation objective. At the same time, political pressure can obstruct policymakers from pricing damage from CO2 emissions according to its social costs. In facilitating decarbonisation, transmission planning will have to adapt to such economic and environmental distortions. Using a Stackelberg model of the Nordic power sector, we find that a first-best transmission-expansion plan involves better resource sharing between zones, which actually reduces the need for some VRE adoption. Next, we allow for departures from perfect competition and identify an extended transmission-expansion plan under market power by nuclear plants. By contrast, temporal arbitrage by hydro reservoirs does not necessitate transmission expansion beyond that of perfect competition because it incentivises sufficient VRE adoption using existing lines. Meanwhile, incomplete CO2 pricing under perfect competition requires a transmission plan that matches hydro-rich zones with sites for VRE adoption. However, since incomplete CO2 pricing leaves fossil-fuelled generation economically viable, it reduces the leverage of strategic producers, thereby catalysing less (more) extensive transmission expansion under market power by nuclear (hydro) plants. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - Finland introduced the planet's first carbon tax in 1990 to experiment with, to most economists, the best policy to reverse carbon emissions. I estimate the causal effect of taxing carbon on Finnish emissions using the Synthetic Control Approach (Abadie, 2021). The results suggest that taxing carbon reduces emissions by big margins. Finnish emissions are 16% lower in 1995, 25% lower in 2000, and 30% lower in 2004 than emissions in the counterfactual consistent with carbon taxes whose value increasing by 20 fold in 1990–2005. The estimates suggest that the carbon tax's abatement elasticity is about 9%. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper introduces an analytical model that characterizes the incentives of the manufacturing industry, consumers, and waste management sectors in closing the material loop. To address identified market failures, various policy instruments are evaluated both theoretically and numerically, using the example of the EU PET market. The assessment shows that a policy package consisting of carbon pricing, advanced disposal fees, and product standards substantially reduces total material consumption and enhances material recovery, leading to a notable reduction in emissions. The analysis of material cost savings, surplus allocation, and social welfare also shows the advantages of such a policy package compared to individual policy instruments. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Herein we study carbon taxation considering the structure of the global production network. With this purpose we characterize how the implementation of a carbon tax in one country-sector can generate sizeable fluctuations on global emissions and welfare through its impact on the structure of production. We then apply this theoretical characterization to accommodate the structure of a multi-regional input–output database. This framework allows us to identify the country-sectors that should be taxed to reach the strongest potential for emission reduction (or welfare maximization) if no coordinated policy is possible. Interestingly, this choice not only depends on emission intensity but also on to which extent the sector is central in the global production network as well as on the pass-through effect on public or private spending. Additionally, we find that synergies between taxes applied to different country-sectors have a strong impact in emission reductions, calling for greater harmonization in carbon taxation around the world. We then use our model to simulate the impact of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) finding that, when looked into sector by sector, it reduces EU competitiveness loss due to carbon pricing but, when generalized to all EU sectors, the impact through the value chain ends up provoking a stronger contraction in the EU than without the CBAM. © 2024

AB  - We investigated whether carbon taxes with and without carbon dividends improve cooperative behavior to mitigate simulated climate change. We implemented a randomized controlled trial on a large sample of the U.S. general population (N=2,116). Played in real-time in groups of four, we tested three carbon-pricing treatments and a baseline condition within a modified threshold public goods game of loss avoidance. We found that a carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends reduces carbon-emitting group consumption relative to a baseline condition with no tax, and relative to a carbon tax only. A carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends paid out to below-average polluters (asymmetric dividend) worked best, with 94% of groups remaining below a critical consumption (emission) threshold. We also found that experiencing the asymmetric dividend condition positively affected perceptions of carbon pricing with carbon dividends. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Reducing animal-based food production would not only reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions but also free land that could sequester carbon. We examine the efficiency of a subsidy to cattle farmers for setting aside land for natural ecosystem regeneration. We develop a partial equilibrium model of the cattle sector that integrates land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and animal feeding. We compare the subsidy to alternative policies: a meat tax and a standard on animal feeding. We identify the conditions under which the subsidy is the best alternative to these other second-best policies. The efficiency of the subsidy lies in its effects on both the extensive margin (reduced quantity of meat) and the intensive margin (production intensification, which reduces both the emission and land-use intensities of meat). An empirical application to France, where spontaneous regeneration corresponds mostly to forest regrowth, shows that the subsidy dominates the other alternative policies considered for a wide range of parameter values but is sensitive to carbon leakage when the economy is open to trade. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Pricing carbon emissions from an individual jurisdiction may harm the competitiveness of local firms, causing the leakage of emissions and economic activity to other regions. Past research concentrates on national carbon prices, but the impacts of subnational carbon prices could be more severe due to the openness of regional economies. We specify a flexible model to capture competition between a plant in a state with electric sector carbon pricing and plants in other states or countries without such pricing. Treating energy prices as a proxy for carbon prices, we estimate model parameters using confidential plant-level Census data, 1982–2011. We simulate the effects on manufacturing output and employment of carbon prices covering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. A carbon price of $10 per metric ton on electricity output reduces employment in the regulated region by 2.1 percent, and raises employment in nearby states by 0.8 percent, although these estimates do not account for revenue recycling in the RGGI region that could mitigate these employment changes. The effects on output are broadly similar. National employment falls just 0.1 percent, suggesting that domestic plants in other states as opposed to foreign facilities gain the most jobs from state or regional carbon pricing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper assesses the use of full-employment computable-general equilibrium (CGE) models to evaluate labor-market effects of environmental policy. Specifically, it compares a full-employment model to two alternatives: a Balistreri model that introduces unemployment through an endogenous wage premium and a search-CGE model that uses a search-and-matching friction to introduce unemployment (extending Hafstead and Williams). We find that some key results are robust across the three models, such as the reallocation of labor across sectors in response to a carbon tax, but that small differences for each industry add up to larger differences across models at the aggregate level. Applying a full-time-equivalent assumption to the full-employment model seriously overestimates the economy-wide net change in jobs (by a factor of more than 2.4 for a carbon tax with revenues returned lump sum and by a factor of almost 2.7 when carbon tax revenue reduces payroll taxes) relative to the search-CGE model. © 2022 The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

AB  - This study examines how electric utilities and regulators can encourage residential consumers to conserve electricity during the hottest summer days and shift electricity load from the day to off-peak, nighttime hours. We analyze a two-year field experiment involving 280 Texas households that explores approaches to conservation and load-shifting to enable emission reductions and reduce generation costs. Our critical peak pricing intervention reduces electricity consumption by 14% on the peak hours of the hottest days, leading to greenhouse gas emission reductions of about 16%. A key contribution of this study is the use of high-frequency appliance-level data. We show that 74% of the critical peak response is from reducing air conditioning. In a complementary nighttime pilot program, consumers respond strongly to lower prices by programming the timing of electric vehicle charging. Our work highlights how automation can influence the consumer tradeoffs relating to effort costs, discomfort, monetary incentives, and warm glow. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The carbon emission rights option (CERO), as a real option, can be used to measure market volatility risk and help enterprises obtain income. However, traditional option pricing models mostly operate under risk neutrality and are unsuitable for CERO pricing. Quantum finance, as a branch of economic physics, can effectively improve the uncertain behavior of financial markets. Therefore, in order to obtain more reasonable results, the study designs a quantum Monte Carlo simulation method for pricing CERO under risk uncertainty. Firstly, real options theory, quantum computing, Monte Carlo simulation, and stochastic volatility (SV) model are combined to achieve quantum state preparation and payoff calculation on quantum circuits. Then, quantum algorithms are used to achieve CERO dynamic pricing. Finally, a case study is conducted using data from the Beijing Green Exchange to verify the convergence and rationality of Quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and its optimization algorithm in CERO pricing. The study results indicate that among the four QAE algorithms adopted, the results of two quantum algorithms are close to the traditional method and have good convergence. Compared to traditional method, the study solves the problem of difficult parameter determination in CERO pricing and reduces the results subjectivity. However, not all quantum algorithms are suitable for CERO pricing. The study further designed various carbon emission trading decisions among enterprises based on pricing results, providing a new approach for the management and operation of carbon assets in enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Internal carbon pricing (ICP) has emerged as an increasingly popular tool for firms to cut emissions and combat climate change risks. We theorize the role of ICP by integrating legitimacy and stakeholder perspectives into dynamic capability theory. We argue that firms implement ICP to comply with stakeholders’ expectations, leading to corporate environmental strategic transformation which in turn improve a firm's dynamic capabilities. Furthermore, we argue that the heterogeneous nature of corporate motivation for such strategy transformation, reflected by carbon dependency and corporate climate target, moderates the relationship between the extent of ICP and the environmental outcomes. The Carbon Disclosure Project data of 500 U.S. publicly listed firms confirms that ICP reduces carbon emissions per employee and carbon emissions per revenue by 13.5% and 15.7%, respectively. Collectively, we advance understanding of corporate business strategy in the presence of climate change risks, posing both theoretical and practical policy implications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We use a set of economic experiments to test the effects of some novel features of California's new controls on greenhouse gas emissions. The California cap and trade scheme imposes limits on allowance ownership, uses a tiered price containment reserve sale, and settles allowance auctions based on the lowest accepted bid. We examine the effects of these features on market liquidity, efficiency, and price variability. We find that tight holding limits substantially reduce banking, which, in turn reduces market liquidity. This impairs the ability of traders to smooth prices over time, resulting in lower efficiency and higher price variability. The price containment reserve, while increasing the supply of allowances available to traders, does not appear to mitigate the effects of tight holding limits on market outcomes. As a result, the imposition of holding limits in the allowance market may have the consequence of increasing the likelihood of the market manipulation that they were intended to prevent. Finally, we find that the choice between lowest accepted bid and highest rejected bid for the allowance auction pricing rule does not have a significant effect on market outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A streamlined model, applied at the member state level, is used to evaluate possibilities for greater reliance on carbon pricing to meet the European Union's mitigation pledge for the Paris Agreement. The economic welfare costs of currently envisioned policies—including the Emissions Trading System (ETS), requirements for energy efficiency, vehicle emission rates, and national targets for non-ETS emissions—are estimated at 1.1% of EU GDP in 2030, or €167 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) reduced. On net these policies lose a small amount of revenue (0.05% of EU GDP). A series of reforms progressively extending emissions pricing across sectors and countries reduces costs by about 0.6% of 2030 EU GDP, or €90 per ton of CO2 reduced, while increasing revenues by almost 1% of EU GDP. Higher emissions prices in the EU ETS would create the largest welfare gain, and no country is made worse off from this reform. © 2019

AB  - We investigate the impact of pricing policies (i.e., flat pricing versus peak pricing) on the investment levels of a utility firm in two competing energy sources (renewable and conventional), with a focus on the renewable investment level.We consider generation patterns and intermittency of solar and wind energy in relation to the electricity demand throughout a day. Industry experts generally promote peak pricing policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the supply system.We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower renewable energy investments. Our study suggests that reducing carbon emissions through increasing renewable energy investments requires careful attention to the pricing policy and the market characteristics of each region.

AB  - Spurred by substantial subsidies, renewable energies have reduced their costs and captured a steadily growing market share. However, the variability of solar and wind power leads to new challenges for power systems. Policy instruments for steering the energy transition towards a zero-carbon future must account for this. We consider an economy in which competitive firms use pollutive fossils, intermittent renewables, and storage for electricity production. A Pigouvian tax is still efficient, because price fluctuations that result from intermittent renewables provide sufficient incentives to invest in storage capacities. However, governments have proved reluctant to impose carbon taxes. Therefore, we examine second-best subsidies when carbon pricing is imperfect. The optimal subsidy rate for renewables decreases as electricity production becomes less reliant on fossils. The storage subsidy is usually negative as long as fossils are dispatched while filling the storage, but turns positive thereafter. This is because more storage capacity reduces the price when stored electricity is supplied to the market, but raises it when storage adds to demand. This has countervailing effects on firms’ incentives to invest in fossil capacities. A numerical simulation illustrates that substantial subsidy payments are required even after fossils have been completely driven out of the market. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of the firms operating on cross-border or inter-regional platforms that are subject to the enforcement of each local government's carbon emissions regulatory policy, thus causing an imbalance in the sharing of the burden of the greening of the total supply chain. We introduce the concept of equity as the incentive mechanism to coordinate this green supply chain which is a function of the carbon emission permits and the revenue generated by the firms. Due to the complexity and imbalance in the original incentive mechanism to this problem, we provide a new equivalent supply chain network equilibrium model under elastic demand based on user equilibrium theory. We state the user equilibrium conditions and provide the equivalent formulation. We show the trade-offs under various carbon emissions regulatory policies. A product with higher price elasticity and carbon emission intensity not only hampers the firm from gaining a higher revenue, but it also reduces the equity of the system under an invariant emission regulatory policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we use a ten-region model of the world economy to analyze the economic and environmental outcomes that are likely to result from the Paris Climate Agreement. To construct our modeling scenario, we first convert the Agreement's disparate Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledges into equivalent reductions in CO2 emissions relative to a baseline scenario without the Agreement. We then model the Agreement by solving for a CO2 price path in each region that would gradually fulfill the region's NDC pledge by its target date. The resulting paths are quite different across regions, indicating significant differences in marginal abatement costs. We also find that if all regions achieve their NDCs, the Agreement significantly reduces CO2 emissions relative to baseline. However, global emissions would not decline in absolute terms relative to 2015 levels, let alone follow a path consistent with a 2 °C stabilization scenario. We then construct additional scenarios to explore how the outcomes of the Agreement would change if particular countries (the United States, China, and Australia) were to unilaterally withdraw from it without undertaking alternative climate policies. We find that leaving the Agreement raises GDP for the country that leaves, but it also sharply reduces the domestic co-benefits the country receives as a side effect of controlling CO2. For each country we consider, the net effect of withdrawing is negative: the loss of co-benefits exceeds the gain in GDP. That is, we show that when co-benefits are considered, it is in each country's self-interest to remain in the Agreement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - From the simulation results of the Energy Modeling Forum's recently completed project on US greenhouse gas emission mitigation policies, this paper estimates and examines welfare effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pricing policies, fuel and technology cost changes, higher electricity demand growth, and limited nuclear generator lifetimes. Eight of the models in the study reported outputs sufficient to estimate damage from CO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and methane, and three of those eight reported outputs sufficient to calculate consumer surplus, supplier profit, government revenue, and therefore total social surplus. Over approximately thirty years, the four CO2 tax policies reduce emissions enough to reduce estimated CO2 damage by $1 to $1.5 trillion, SO2 damage by $1 to $1.3 trillion, and NOX and methane damage by smaller amounts, based on averaging the results from the relevant models. The estimated non-environmental social surplus cost of each of these policies is between 23% and 29% of its environmental benefit. The CO2 cap-and-trade scenario, modeled after the Clean Power Plan, reduces estimated CO2 damage and other emission damage each by $0.4 trillion, at a non-environmental social surplus cost estimated to be 17% of the environmental benefit. Changing the natural gas price changes SO2 damage more than twice as much as it changes CO2 damage. Estimated methane emissions move in the same direction as CO2 emissions in every scenario other than the low natural gas price scenario, in which the methane increase counteracts an estimated 27% of the benefit from the CO2 reduction but only 5% of the total net benefit. In addition, the paper explains the set of assumptions and methods used to estimate environmental damage, and briefly explains how the non-environmental parts of total social surplus can sometimes be computed from more common results if necessary. © 2018

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 health crisis, the French government has imposed drastic lockdown measures for a period of 55 days. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO2 emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - China formally launched a national carbon trading market in the power sector in 2017. However, electricity prices in China are still subject to government regulation, which reduces the cost-effectiveness of the carbon pricing policy. This study uses a computable general equilibrium model to explore how China's electricity prices can be deregulated in two stages in the context of implementing carbon pricing in the electricity sector. The results show that under different government policy objectives, the choice of electricity price deregulation is different. If the government intends to significantly reduce marginal abatement costs and promote carbon emission reductions, the electricity price deregulation of non-key electricity consumption sectors should be prioritized in the first stage and that of the national protected sectors in the second stage. Conversely, if the government intends to reduce GDP losses, households' disposable income, and welfare losses effectively, the liberalization of the electricity prices of key electricity consumption sectors should be prioritized in the first stage and that of the household sector in the second stage. Taking 50% of the reduction targets in the electricity sector as an example, if the key electricity consumption sectors and households are prioritized, GDP losses are reduced by 3.6% and 13%, respectively. The results of this study provide new information for China to implement electricity market reform in the context of carbon pricing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Textbook theory of linking carbon systems suggests linking reduces marginal abatement costs. Contrasting theoretical work and policy analyses suggests that linking, or at least unfettered linking, may not always be beneficial. The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) is unique in that, until 2013, it allowed unlimited use of Kyoto allowances. NZ ETS, thus provides an ideal context to explore the effect of linking and linking restrictions on carbon pricing of small systems. Using data on importation and exportation of allowances, we provide the first empirical analysis of the determinants of allowance prices in the early phase of the NZ ETS. Our results indicate that imports of offsets rather than fundamentals have been the major price determinant. Moreover, the pricing of New Zealand units (NZUs) can be placed into three distinct periods, delineated by two structural breaks. In the first period, the system is largely autarkic; in the second period, as international offset prices drop below the NZU price, the system becomes a “price taker”; in the final period, following policy interventions, the system regains some independence. The case of the NZ ETS shows that small trading systems need to impose, or have the option to impose, quantitative import restriction so as to reap the benefits (lower abatement cost), but not the drawbacks (“importation” of distortions and market integrity issues), of linking. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The presence of consumers able to respond to changes in wholesale electricity prices facilitates the penetration of renewable intermittent sources of energy such as wind or sun power. We investigate how adapting demand to intermittent electricity supply by making consumers price-responsive - thanks to smart meters and home automation appliances - impacts the energy mix. We show that it almost always reduces carbon emissions. Furthermore, when consumers are not too risk-averse, demand response is socially beneficial because the loss from exposing consumers to volatile prices is more than offset by lower production and environmental costs. However, the gain is decreasing when the proportion of reactive consumers increases. Therefore, depending on the costs of the necessary smart hardware, it may be non-optimal to equip the whole population. © 2021

AB  - Fiscal considerations may shift governmental priorities away from environmental concerns: finance ministers face strong demand for public expenditures such as infrastructure investments but they are constrained by international tax competition. We develop a multi-region model of tax competition and resource extraction to assess the fiscal incentive of imposing a tax on carbon rather than on capital. We explicitly model international capital and resource markets, as well as intertemporal capital accumulation and resource extraction. While fossil resources give rise to scarcity rents, capital does not. With carbon taxes, the rents can be captured and invested in infrastructure, which leads to higher welfare than under capital taxation. This result holds even without modeling environmental damages. It is robust under a variation of the behavioral assumptions of resource importers to coordinate their actions, and a resource exporter’s ability to counteract carbon policies. Further, no green paradox occurs—instead, the carbon tax constitutes a viable green policy, since it postpones extraction and reduces cumulative emissions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
