AB  - A matter of debate in climate policy is whether lawmakers should rely on carbon pricing or regulations, such as low-carbon standards, to reach emission reduction goals. Past research showed that pricing is more cost-effective. However, previous work studied the two policies when implemented separately, in effect comparing two policy extremes. In contrast, we explore the full spectrum of climate policy mixes that include both types of policies but vary in how much they rely on each. We do this both analytically by extending previous theory and numerically with two energy system models. In line with past work, increasing reliance on pricing increases the cost-effectiveness of the policy mix. However, we show that this benefit exhibits diminishing marginal returns. Thus the gain in cost-effectiveness from complementing stringent standards with modest pricing is relatively large. Our results show that relying on pricing for 20% of emission reductions (and on a standard for 80%) reduces costs by 32%–57% compared to a standard-only approach. Importantly, trading off more of the standard for pricing delivers smaller and smaller gains in cost-effectiveness. For example, a policy mix that relies on each policy for 50% of emission reductions decreases costs by 60%–81%, which is already 71%–88% as cost-effective as the theoretically most cost-effective pricing-only policy. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Trade reduces the effectiveness of climate policies such as carbon pricing when domestic products are replaced by more carbon-intensive imports. We investigate the impact of unilateral carbon pricing on electricity generation in a country open to trade through interconnection lines. We characterize the energy mix with intermittent renewable sources of energy (wind or solar power). Electricity trade limits the penetration of renewables due to trade-induced competition. A carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) removes this limit by increasing the cost of imported power, or by deterring imports. The CBAM must be complemented by a subsidy on renewables to increase renewable generation above domestic consumption. The interconnection line is then used to export power rather than importing it when renewables are producing. We also examine network pricing and investment into interconnection capacity. A higher carbon price increases interconnection investment which further reduces the effectiveness of carbon pricing. In contrast, when renewable electricity is exported, a higher subsidy on renewables reduces further carbon emissions by expanding interconnection capacity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Carbon pricing policies can play an important role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. However, policymakers often cite the lack of public support as a major obstacle to adopting and expanding the coverage of such policies. Using data from a large cross-country survey of about 28,500 people across 28 countries conducted during the summer of 2022, we show that providing information about the costs and benefits of carbon pricing can swing public support. Highlighting the efficacy and revenue recycling potential of carbon pricing increases support, especially in emerging market economies. In contrast, highlighting costs reduces support, but less so for people who report being already significantly impacted by climate change. Moreover, people adopt more negative views of subsidies for renewable energy and low-carbon technologies when the salience of their costs is increased, with the shift being more pronounced for people, especially in advanced economies, who believe that effective climate polices require global efforts. Our results suggest that there is scope to increase public support for climate mitigation measures by providing people with the policy information they may lack. © 2024 International Monetary Fund.

AB  - Policymakers face the challenge of integrating intermittent output from variable renewable energy (VRE). Even in a well-functioning power sector with flexible generation, producers’ incentives may not align with society's welfare-maximisation objective. At the same time, political pressure can obstruct policymakers from pricing damage from CO2 emissions according to its social costs. In facilitating decarbonisation, transmission planning will have to adapt to such economic and environmental distortions. Using a Stackelberg model of the Nordic power sector, we find that a first-best transmission-expansion plan involves better resource sharing between zones, which actually reduces the need for some VRE adoption. Next, we allow for departures from perfect competition and identify an extended transmission-expansion plan under market power by nuclear plants. By contrast, temporal arbitrage by hydro reservoirs does not necessitate transmission expansion beyond that of perfect competition because it incentivises sufficient VRE adoption using existing lines. Meanwhile, incomplete CO2 pricing under perfect competition requires a transmission plan that matches hydro-rich zones with sites for VRE adoption. However, since incomplete CO2 pricing leaves fossil-fuelled generation economically viable, it reduces the leverage of strategic producers, thereby catalysing less (more) extensive transmission expansion under market power by nuclear (hydro) plants. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - The transition towards a low-carbon economy is crucial to achieve the Paris climate goals, but it also presents the risk of stranded assets across various industries. However, existing research has mainly focused on upstream and power sectors, leaving the stranded asset risk of individual assets less understood. This study proposes a real options-based framework for evaluating the stranding risk of carbon-intensive assets. To illustrate its practical application, we apply the framework to a fossil-fuel-powered bulk carrier. The results show that under carbon pricing, the shipowner should expect to bear approximately US$26.5 million of stranded asset risk, which would decrease to US$25.2 million if the ship reduces speed to comply with carbon intensity regulations. We conclude that our framework will enable an adequate assessment of these risks, leading to more practical implications for investment decision-making and supporting climate risk management. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Finland introduced the planet's first carbon tax in 1990 to experiment with, to most economists, the best policy to reverse carbon emissions. I estimate the causal effect of taxing carbon on Finnish emissions using the Synthetic Control Approach (Abadie, 2021). The results suggest that taxing carbon reduces emissions by big margins. Finnish emissions are 16% lower in 1995, 25% lower in 2000, and 30% lower in 2004 than emissions in the counterfactual consistent with carbon taxes whose value increasing by 20 fold in 1990–2005. The estimates suggest that the carbon tax's abatement elasticity is about 9%. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper introduces an analytical model that characterizes the incentives of the manufacturing industry, consumers, and waste management sectors in closing the material loop. To address identified market failures, various policy instruments are evaluated both theoretically and numerically, using the example of the EU PET market. The assessment shows that a policy package consisting of carbon pricing, advanced disposal fees, and product standards substantially reduces total material consumption and enhances material recovery, leading to a notable reduction in emissions. The analysis of material cost savings, surplus allocation, and social welfare also shows the advantages of such a policy package compared to individual policy instruments. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - To mitigate the significant environmental impacts of the shipping industry, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) introduced the Carbon Intensity Indicator (CII), which measures CO2 emissions per unit of cargo-carrying capacity and distance traveled. While the implementation of energy-efficient technologies is crucial for meeting CII regulations, these advancements often entail substantial investment costs. Consequently, optimizing operations has become a more practical short-term approach; however, operational adjustments made solely to comply with CII regulations may also have unintended adverse effects. To address this issue, this research develops a pick up and delivery optimization model for tramp ships, which operate on irregular schedules and routes, to minimize total emissions and costs while complying with CII regulations. The model investigates the combination of cargo selection, route planning, and speed optimization, reflecting the comprehensive and unique characteristics of tramp shipping. The problem is solved using Danzig-Wolfe decomposition and a branch-and-price algorithm, with the CII regulations being met in the pricing problem through a customized heuristic. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach can find optimal or near-optimal solutions within a short time. Various experiments explore the effects of CII regulations on tramp shipping operations, environmental performances, and economic benefits. The results indicate that demand-based CII and stricter CII regulations cause ships to carry fewer cargoes, sail shorter ballast distances, reduce speed, and increase load on board. This ultimately reduces CO2 emissions but also lowers total profits. The findings assist industry stakeholders in complying with stringent environmental regulations and aid policymakers in designing targeted regulatory policies, thereby promoting sustainable maritime transport. © 2024

AB  - This paper applies an energy systems model to evaluate how shared mobility (ride-hailing and shared autonomous vehicles), public buses, alternative energy sources (electricity and biofuels) and carbon pricing contribute to reduce passenger vehicles CO2 emissions in Rio de Janeiro state, Brazil, from 2016 to 2050. Public buses and carpooled shared mobility increase system capacity, resulting in lower vehicle ownership, energy demand and CO2 emissions, as well as savings per ton of CO2 abated (from $3 to $4186). Biofuels reduce CO2 emissions at no increased system cost, while carbon pricing is the most effective policy to reduce CO2 emissions, but it is costlier than the alternatives and results in greater private vehicle use (up to 260%) if the expansion of zero-carbon public transportation remains limited due to technology adoption. The policy that reduces the most emissions (by 84%) combines the expansion of renewable electricity generation and implementation of a CO2 price. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Herein we study carbon taxation considering the structure of the global production network. With this purpose we characterize how the implementation of a carbon tax in one country-sector can generate sizeable fluctuations on global emissions and welfare through its impact on the structure of production. We then apply this theoretical characterization to accommodate the structure of a multi-regional input–output database. This framework allows us to identify the country-sectors that should be taxed to reach the strongest potential for emission reduction (or welfare maximization) if no coordinated policy is possible. Interestingly, this choice not only depends on emission intensity but also on to which extent the sector is central in the global production network as well as on the pass-through effect on public or private spending. Additionally, we find that synergies between taxes applied to different country-sectors have a strong impact in emission reductions, calling for greater harmonization in carbon taxation around the world. We then use our model to simulate the impact of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) finding that, when looked into sector by sector, it reduces EU competitiveness loss due to carbon pricing but, when generalized to all EU sectors, the impact through the value chain ends up provoking a stronger contraction in the EU than without the CBAM. © 2024

AB  - This study investigates a sustainable three-echelon supply chain structure (supplier–retailer–customer) from the retailer's perspective for a perishable product where: (1) the retailer pays the purchase cost to the supplier in the form of an advance-cash-credit (ACC) payment while granting their customers a partial credit, (2) the supplier offers a price discount to the retailer to facilitate sales, (3) the deterioration rate of items increases over time due to an expiration date, (4) the customer is allowed a partial delay in orders with a fixed market tolerance period, and (5) the supply chain management (SCM) structure takes consideration of government cap-and-trade regulation. This paper intends to establish the retailer's optimum cycle time, selling price, and inventory period simultaneously to maximize his/her total profit. An efficient algorithm has been constructed to find optimal solutions. Two examples have been presented to validate the proposed model. Furthermore, a comparative analysis of the four different payment methods (upstream ACC, advance, cash, credit, and downstream partial credit payments) has been carried out and sensitivity analyses have been performed to gain managerial insights. Our numerical results reveal that with the increase in the discount rate, the selling price reduces significantly, however, the retailer's profit increases tremendously. The reason for this phenomenon is that a higher discount rate can lead to a higher profit for the retailer, hence, the retailer may set a lower price to increase sales. Many retailers desire a high discount rate, which is associated with the upstream advance and downstream partial credit payment; however, the computational results show that this payment method causes significant damage to the environment. Hence, two payment methods (upstream ACC, credit, and downstream partial credit payments) are recommended. The reason is that these two payment types bring more profits to the retailer and result in less damage to the environment. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Electricity pricing can be used to shift the timing of electricity demand, but the choice of price signals is highly constrained. Consumer rates are updated every few years and limited to simple daily profiles, yet must capture the complex dynamics of a changing electricity system. Emission factors (EFs) were developed as an evaluation tool, but are increasingly used as demand response (DR) signals. Given these constraints, can they be effective? We evaluate the emissions impact of EF-based electricity rates with and without supply-side emissions pricing. We study controlled electric vehicle (EV) charging in the Western U.S. up to 2037 by coupling an electricity system dispatch model and a data-driven EV charging model. We compare average and short-run marginal EFs with a new medium-run marginal EF that better matches the timeline of electricity rate updates. We find that a stable supply-side signal makes DR more valuable: DR reduces emissions by up to 6% with supply-side carbon pricing or just 2% without it. Medium-run marginal EFs yield the most consistent emission reductions, but constraints on charging flexibility limit their impact. We recommend policymakers base rates for DR on medium-run marginal emission factors and implement supply-side carbon pricing to facilitate greater emission reductions. © 2024

AB  - How do policymakers manage the tension between enforcing a carbon price and ensuring low-cost electricity provision? This paper answers this question in two steps. First, it combines literature on electricity market design and rent management to arrive at a novel analytical framework. Carbon pricing can disrupt longstanding rent transfers between the state and electricity consumers by making it more expensive to produce and/or consume fossil fuel-based electricity. We theorize that policymakers respond to this dilemma by making incremental policy design adjustments to gradually enforce rent losses across the electricity production value chain. We apply this framework to study the implementation of the Korean emissions trading scheme (ETS) policy 2015–2022. Drawing on 20 expert interviews and policy documents we identify an initial sequence of policy design adjustments which enable, but also delay, the enforcement of the carbon price signal in the electricity system. This incremental and politically contentious process reduces the ETS policy’s ability to abate greenhouse gas emissions from the Korean electricity sector in the short term. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of carbon pricing in the electricity sector hinge on the parallel construction of supportive institutions to permit meaningful carbon cost pass-through. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Reducing animal-based food production would not only reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions but also free land that could sequester carbon. We examine the efficiency of a subsidy to cattle farmers for setting aside land for natural ecosystem regeneration. We develop a partial equilibrium model of the cattle sector that integrates land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and animal feeding. We compare the subsidy to alternative policies: a meat tax and a standard on animal feeding. We identify the conditions under which the subsidy is the best alternative to these other second-best policies. The efficiency of the subsidy lies in its effects on both the extensive margin (reduced quantity of meat) and the intensive margin (production intensification, which reduces both the emission and land-use intensities of meat). An empirical application to France, where spontaneous regeneration corresponds mostly to forest regrowth, shows that the subsidy dominates the other alternative policies considered for a wide range of parameter values but is sensitive to carbon leakage when the economy is open to trade. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This paper assesses the impact of the Pilot of Critical Peak Pricing for Industrial Electricity (PCPPIE) on industrial Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by employing the Difference-in-Differences (DID) methodology. It is found that the cities participating in PCPPIE underwent a significant 11.3% reduction in the GHGs emitted per industrial enterprise. These findings remain robust across various methodologies, including staggered DID estimators, propensity score matching, instrumental variable methods, and spatial econometric regression. The generalized DID analysis shows that a higher critical peak price corresponds to a more substantial decrease in GHG emissions. PCPPIE achieves weaker GHG reduction in higher-administrative level cities but stronger in those with higher industrial share, and the effectiveness of PCPPIE is compromised by cross-regional electricity imports. PCPPIE reduces GHG emission intensity of the power industry and contributes to additional reductions in GHG emissions from other sources by fostering green technological innovation and facilitating energy substitution. The practical significance of this paper is to reveal a richer dynamic mechanism for China's green and sustainable development, indicating that critical peak pricing is a power pricing strategy worthy of strengthening and optimization in the process of China's carbon peak and carbon neutrality. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The design and conduct of climate change policy necessarily confronts uncertainty along multiple fronts. We explore the consequences of ambiguity over various sources and configurations of models that affect how economic opportunities could be damaged in the future.We appeal to decision theory under risk, model ambiguity, and misspecification concerns to provide an economically motivated approach to uncertainty quantification. We show how this approach reduces the many facets of uncertainty into a lowdimensional characterization that depends on the uncertainty aversion of a decision maker or fictitious social planner. In our computations, we take inventory of three alternative channels of uncertainty and provide a novel way to assess them. These include (i) carbon dynamics that capture how carbon emissions affect atmospheric carbon in future time periods, (ii) temperature dynamics that depict how atmospheric carbon alters temperature in future time periods, and (iii) damage functions that quantify how temperature changes diminish economic opportunities. We appeal to geoscientific modeling to quantify the first two channels. We show how these uncertainty sources interact for a social planner looking to design a prudent approach to the social pricing of carbon emissions. © 2022, University of Chicago Press.

AB  - Pricing carbon emissions from an individual jurisdiction may harm the competitiveness of local firms, causing the leakage of emissions and economic activity to other regions. Past research concentrates on national carbon prices, but the impacts of subnational carbon prices could be more severe due to the openness of regional economies. We specify a flexible model to capture competition between a plant in a state with electric sector carbon pricing and plants in other states or countries without such pricing. Treating energy prices as a proxy for carbon prices, we estimate model parameters using confidential plant-level Census data, 1982–2011. We simulate the effects on manufacturing output and employment of carbon prices covering the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. A carbon price of $10 per metric ton on electricity output reduces employment in the regulated region by 2.1 percent, and raises employment in nearby states by 0.8 percent, although these estimates do not account for revenue recycling in the RGGI region that could mitigate these employment changes. The effects on output are broadly similar. National employment falls just 0.1 percent, suggesting that domestic plants in other states as opposed to foreign facilities gain the most jobs from state or regional carbon pricing. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This paper assesses the use of full-employment computable-general equilibrium (CGE) models to evaluate labor-market effects of environmental policy. Specifically, it compares a full-employment model to two alternatives: a Balistreri model that introduces unemployment through an endogenous wage premium and a search-CGE model that uses a search-and-matching friction to introduce unemployment (extending Hafstead and Williams). We find that some key results are robust across the three models, such as the reallocation of labor across sectors in response to a carbon tax, but that small differences for each industry add up to larger differences across models at the aggregate level. Applying a full-time-equivalent assumption to the full-employment model seriously overestimates the economy-wide net change in jobs (by a factor of more than 2.4 for a carbon tax with revenues returned lump sum and by a factor of almost 2.7 when carbon tax revenue reduces payroll taxes) relative to the search-CGE model. © 2022 The Association of Environmental and Resource Economists.

AB  - This study examines how electric utilities and regulators can encourage residential consumers to conserve electricity during the hottest summer days and shift electricity load from the day to off-peak, nighttime hours. We analyze a two-year field experiment involving 280 Texas households that explores approaches to conservation and load-shifting to enable emission reductions and reduce generation costs. Our critical peak pricing intervention reduces electricity consumption by 14% on the peak hours of the hottest days, leading to greenhouse gas emission reductions of about 16%. A key contribution of this study is the use of high-frequency appliance-level data. We show that 74% of the critical peak response is from reducing air conditioning. In a complementary nighttime pilot program, consumers respond strongly to lower prices by programming the timing of electric vehicle charging. Our work highlights how automation can influence the consumer tradeoffs relating to effort costs, discomfort, monetary incentives, and warm glow. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - The carbon emission rights option (CERO), as a real option, can be used to measure market volatility risk and help enterprises obtain income. However, traditional option pricing models mostly operate under risk neutrality and are unsuitable for CERO pricing. Quantum finance, as a branch of economic physics, can effectively improve the uncertain behavior of financial markets. Therefore, in order to obtain more reasonable results, the study designs a quantum Monte Carlo simulation method for pricing CERO under risk uncertainty. Firstly, real options theory, quantum computing, Monte Carlo simulation, and stochastic volatility (SV) model are combined to achieve quantum state preparation and payoff calculation on quantum circuits. Then, quantum algorithms are used to achieve CERO dynamic pricing. Finally, a case study is conducted using data from the Beijing Green Exchange to verify the convergence and rationality of Quantum amplitude estimation (QAE) and its optimization algorithm in CERO pricing. The study results indicate that among the four QAE algorithms adopted, the results of two quantum algorithms are close to the traditional method and have good convergence. Compared to traditional method, the study solves the problem of difficult parameter determination in CERO pricing and reduces the results subjectivity. However, not all quantum algorithms are suitable for CERO pricing. The study further designed various carbon emission trading decisions among enterprises based on pricing results, providing a new approach for the management and operation of carbon assets in enterprises. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Internal carbon pricing (ICP) has emerged as an increasingly popular tool for firms to cut emissions and combat climate change risks. We theorize the role of ICP by integrating legitimacy and stakeholder perspectives into dynamic capability theory. We argue that firms implement ICP to comply with stakeholders’ expectations, leading to corporate environmental strategic transformation which in turn improve a firm's dynamic capabilities. Furthermore, we argue that the heterogeneous nature of corporate motivation for such strategy transformation, reflected by carbon dependency and corporate climate target, moderates the relationship between the extent of ICP and the environmental outcomes. The Carbon Disclosure Project data of 500 U.S. publicly listed firms confirms that ICP reduces carbon emissions per employee and carbon emissions per revenue by 13.5% and 15.7%, respectively. Collectively, we advance understanding of corporate business strategy in the presence of climate change risks, posing both theoretical and practical policy implications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Traffic is a major contributor to emissions in many large cities with severe air pollution. Experience in London, Milan, and Stockholm shows that charging for the use of roads can be effective in reducing emissions, as well as congestion. This study examines the use of predictive cordon tolls based on weather forecasts to reduce ambient air pollution and congestion. Travelers choose their destinations inside or outside the cordon, and whether to drive or take public transport. Passenger vehicles are divided into three classes according to their emission characteristics, and higher tolls are imposed on more polluting vehicles. The Box model of emission dispersion is used to predict air quality. A Markov decision-making process then determines daily toll levels with the objective of maximizing welfare measured by travelers’ surplus, toll revenue, and air pollution health costs. The model is applied to a hypothetical network using recorded weather data for Tehran in 2016. With base-case parameter values, predictive pricing reduces the daily average CO concentration as well as the number of days with dangerous air quality. Predictive pricing yields a higher welfare gain than a fixed toll (i.e., the same every day regardless of weather conditions). The effects of weather information, wind forecast accuracy, forecast time horizon, values of travel time, destination attractions, and road link capacity on the benefits from predictive pricing are analyzed. The performance of the model under randomized weather conditions is also assessed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The consensus findings from climate scientists regarding potential future climate change and associated damages have become increasingly ominous over the last decade. These findings reveal that in the absence of significant reductions in CO2 emissions, atmospheric concentrations of CO2 stand a significant chance of causing increases in global average surface temperature that are large enough to produce very serious climate-related damages within a decade or two. They imply that stronger policy action-beyond what has been pledged in the 2015 Paris Accord-is urgently needed. This article has indicated how economists can help reveal more clearly the urgency of stronger policy action. Such clarification requires policy evaluations that focus more sharply on the timing of policy action and the economic costs that result from delayed implementation. I have shown that economists can achieve this sharper focus in several ways. One is simply to place greater emphasis on the fact that earlier action reduces costs. A second is to expand the development and application of numerical models that reveal the economic impacts on key stakeholder groups. Such models provide information relevant to political feasibility and the prospects for near-term implementation. A third is to include attention to the timing of implementation in comparisons of the costs of policy alternatives. Other things being equal, a policy that is likely to be implemented sooner will have a cost advantage. A fourth is to apply IAMs to alternative emissions scenarios designed to isolate the costs of delay. These costs reflect either the additional climate damages from the higher future concentrations attributable to delayed emissions reductions or the extra abatement costs attributable to the future acceleration of emissions reductions that would be needed to avoid the future increase in concentrations that otherwise would result from delay. As discussed here, greater attention to the prospects for near-term implementation can alter the cost rankings of U.S. climate policy alternatives, increasing the attractiveness of some climate policy approaches that economists might otherwise tend to dismiss. While carbon pricing has several advantages over other instruments for CO2 abatement, I would argue that consideration of the prospects for near-term implementation justifies giving alternative approaches a closer look. By bringing out more effectively the significance of the timing of policy implementation and the costs of delay, economists can provide better guidance to policymakers struggling to address what is arguably the world's most urgent and important environmental problem. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - A streamlined model, applied at the member state level, is used to evaluate possibilities for greater reliance on carbon pricing to meet the European Union's mitigation pledge for the Paris Agreement. The economic welfare costs of currently envisioned policies—including the Emissions Trading System (ETS), requirements for energy efficiency, vehicle emission rates, and national targets for non-ETS emissions—are estimated at 1.1% of EU GDP in 2030, or €167 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) reduced. On net these policies lose a small amount of revenue (0.05% of EU GDP). A series of reforms progressively extending emissions pricing across sectors and countries reduces costs by about 0.6% of 2030 EU GDP, or €90 per ton of CO2 reduced, while increasing revenues by almost 1% of EU GDP. Higher emissions prices in the EU ETS would create the largest welfare gain, and no country is made worse off from this reform. © 2019

AB  - This paper surveys pricing mechanisms used by government agencies to manage congestion, as well as highlights the many political and social issues that have to be addressed in order to implement a pricing mechanism. This survey was undertaken in order to be able to understand how congestion pricing could be used to help manage airspace capacity. This is an important question since a 2008 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress suggested that domestic air traffic delays in 2007 cost the economy as much as $41 billion, including $19 billion in increased operational costs for the airlines and $12 billion worth of lost time for passengers.The paper begins by surveying roadway congestion approaches throughout the world. We survey the successes that peak pricing charges have had on reducing congestion. We also report the other benefits that such practices have had: improving the public transportation network, improving the economy of the region, reducing carbon emissions, and creating new urban living spaces. We next examine other applications of congestion pricing, including managing demand for canal and bridges passage, port usage, access to city centers, and peak use of energy resources.The paper ends with a proposal for a two-staged approach to the management of air space and runway congestion. The first stage imposes a service standard on runway access that is consistent with an airport's capacity during good weather days. Then, when weather reduces capacity either in the airspace or on runways, we propose a congestion pricing mechanism that charges flights based on the amount of congestion the flight imposes on the entire system. © 2012.

AB  - We investigate the impact of pricing policies (i.e., flat pricing versus peak pricing) on the investment levels of a utility firm in two competing energy sources (renewable and conventional), with a focus on the renewable investment level.We consider generation patterns and intermittency of solar and wind energy in relation to the electricity demand throughout a day. Industry experts generally promote peak pricing policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the supply system.We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower renewable energy investments. Our study suggests that reducing carbon emissions through increasing renewable energy investments requires careful attention to the pricing policy and the market characteristics of each region.

AB  - Heterogeneous fleet vehicles can be used to reduce carbon emissions. We propose an improved branch-and-price (BAP) algorithm to precisely solve the heterogeneous fleet green vehicle routing problem with time windows (HFGVRPTW). In the improved BAP, to speed up the solution for the pricing problem, we develop a multi-vehicle approximate dynamic programming (MVADP) algorithm that is based on the labeling algorithm. The MVADP algorithm reduces labels by integrating the calculation of pricing problems for all vehicle types. In addition, to rapidly obtain a tighter upper bound, we propose an integer branch method. For each branch, we solve the master problem with the integer constraint by the CPLEX solver using the columns produced by column generation. We retain the smaller of the obtained integer solution and the current upper bound, and the branches are thus reduced significantly. Extensive computational experiments were performed on the Solomon benchmark instances. The results show that the branches and computational time were reduced significantly by the improved BAP algorithm. © 2019

AB  - Spurred by substantial subsidies, renewable energies have reduced their costs and captured a steadily growing market share. However, the variability of solar and wind power leads to new challenges for power systems. Policy instruments for steering the energy transition towards a zero-carbon future must account for this. We consider an economy in which competitive firms use pollutive fossils, intermittent renewables, and storage for electricity production. A Pigouvian tax is still efficient, because price fluctuations that result from intermittent renewables provide sufficient incentives to invest in storage capacities. However, governments have proved reluctant to impose carbon taxes. Therefore, we examine second-best subsidies when carbon pricing is imperfect. The optimal subsidy rate for renewables decreases as electricity production becomes less reliant on fossils. The storage subsidy is usually negative as long as fossils are dispatched while filling the storage, but turns positive thereafter. This is because more storage capacity reduces the price when stored electricity is supplied to the market, but raises it when storage adds to demand. This has countervailing effects on firms’ incentives to invest in fossil capacities. A numerical simulation illustrates that substantial subsidy payments are required even after fossils have been completely driven out of the market. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of the firms operating on cross-border or inter-regional platforms that are subject to the enforcement of each local government's carbon emissions regulatory policy, thus causing an imbalance in the sharing of the burden of the greening of the total supply chain. We introduce the concept of equity as the incentive mechanism to coordinate this green supply chain which is a function of the carbon emission permits and the revenue generated by the firms. Due to the complexity and imbalance in the original incentive mechanism to this problem, we provide a new equivalent supply chain network equilibrium model under elastic demand based on user equilibrium theory. We state the user equilibrium conditions and provide the equivalent formulation. We show the trade-offs under various carbon emissions regulatory policies. A product with higher price elasticity and carbon emission intensity not only hampers the firm from gaining a higher revenue, but it also reduces the equity of the system under an invariant emission regulatory policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - In this paper, we use a ten-region model of the world economy to analyze the economic and environmental outcomes that are likely to result from the Paris Climate Agreement. To construct our modeling scenario, we first convert the Agreement's disparate Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledges into equivalent reductions in CO2 emissions relative to a baseline scenario without the Agreement. We then model the Agreement by solving for a CO2 price path in each region that would gradually fulfill the region's NDC pledge by its target date. The resulting paths are quite different across regions, indicating significant differences in marginal abatement costs. We also find that if all regions achieve their NDCs, the Agreement significantly reduces CO2 emissions relative to baseline. However, global emissions would not decline in absolute terms relative to 2015 levels, let alone follow a path consistent with a 2 °C stabilization scenario. We then construct additional scenarios to explore how the outcomes of the Agreement would change if particular countries (the United States, China, and Australia) were to unilaterally withdraw from it without undertaking alternative climate policies. We find that leaving the Agreement raises GDP for the country that leaves, but it also sharply reduces the domestic co-benefits the country receives as a side effect of controlling CO2. For each country we consider, the net effect of withdrawing is negative: the loss of co-benefits exceeds the gain in GDP. That is, we show that when co-benefits are considered, it is in each country's self-interest to remain in the Agreement. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - From the simulation results of the Energy Modeling Forum's recently completed project on US greenhouse gas emission mitigation policies, this paper estimates and examines welfare effects of carbon dioxide (CO2) pricing policies, fuel and technology cost changes, higher electricity demand growth, and limited nuclear generator lifetimes. Eight of the models in the study reported outputs sufficient to estimate damage from CO2, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and methane, and three of those eight reported outputs sufficient to calculate consumer surplus, supplier profit, government revenue, and therefore total social surplus. Over approximately thirty years, the four CO2 tax policies reduce emissions enough to reduce estimated CO2 damage by $1 to $1.5 trillion, SO2 damage by $1 to $1.3 trillion, and NOX and methane damage by smaller amounts, based on averaging the results from the relevant models. The estimated non-environmental social surplus cost of each of these policies is between 23% and 29% of its environmental benefit. The CO2 cap-and-trade scenario, modeled after the Clean Power Plan, reduces estimated CO2 damage and other emission damage each by $0.4 trillion, at a non-environmental social surplus cost estimated to be 17% of the environmental benefit. Changing the natural gas price changes SO2 damage more than twice as much as it changes CO2 damage. Estimated methane emissions move in the same direction as CO2 emissions in every scenario other than the low natural gas price scenario, in which the methane increase counteracts an estimated 27% of the benefit from the CO2 reduction but only 5% of the total net benefit. In addition, the paper explains the set of assumptions and methods used to estimate environmental damage, and briefly explains how the non-environmental parts of total social surplus can sometimes be computed from more common results if necessary. © 2018

AB  - In response to the COVID-19 health crisis, the French government has imposed drastic lockdown measures for a period of 55 days. This paper provides a quantitative assessment of the economic and environmental impacts of these measures in the short and long term. We use a Computable General Equilibrium model designed to assess environmental and energy policies impacts at the macroeconomic and sectoral levels. We find that the lockdown has led to a significant decrease in economic output of 5% of GDP, but a positive environmental impact with a 6.6% reduction in CO2 emissions in 2020. Both decreases are temporary: economic and environmental indicators return to their baseline trajectory after a few years. CO2 emissions even end up significantly higher after the COVID-19 crisis when we account for persistently low oil prices. We then investigate whether implementing carbon pricing can still yield positive macroeconomic dividends in the post-COVID recovery. We find that implementing ambitious carbon pricing speeds up economic recovery while significantly reducing CO2 emissions. By maintaining high fossil fuel prices, carbon taxation reduces the imports of fossil energy and stimulates energy efficiency investments while the full redistribution of tax proceeds does not hamper the recovery. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - China formally launched a national carbon trading market in the power sector in 2017. However, electricity prices in China are still subject to government regulation, which reduces the cost-effectiveness of the carbon pricing policy. This study uses a computable general equilibrium model to explore how China's electricity prices can be deregulated in two stages in the context of implementing carbon pricing in the electricity sector. The results show that under different government policy objectives, the choice of electricity price deregulation is different. If the government intends to significantly reduce marginal abatement costs and promote carbon emission reductions, the electricity price deregulation of non-key electricity consumption sectors should be prioritized in the first stage and that of the national protected sectors in the second stage. Conversely, if the government intends to reduce GDP losses, households' disposable income, and welfare losses effectively, the liberalization of the electricity prices of key electricity consumption sectors should be prioritized in the first stage and that of the household sector in the second stage. Taking 50% of the reduction targets in the electricity sector as an example, if the key electricity consumption sectors and households are prioritized, GDP losses are reduced by 3.6% and 13%, respectively. The results of this study provide new information for China to implement electricity market reform in the context of carbon pricing. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - For the transport sector, promoting carpooling to private car users could be an effective strategy over reducing vehicle kilometers traveled. Theoretical studies have verified that carpooling is not only beneficial to drivers and passengers but also to the environment. Nevertheless, despite carpooling having a huge potential market in car commuters, it is not widely used in practice worldwide. In this paper, we develop a passenger-to-driver matching model based on the characteristics of a private-car based carpooling service, and propose an estimation method for time-based costs as well as the psychological costs of carpooling trips, taking into account the potential motivations and preferences of potential carpoolers. We test the model using commuting data for the Greater London from the UK Census 2011 and travel-time data from Uber. We investigate the service sensitivity to varying carpooling participant rates and fee-sharing ratios with the aim of improving matching performance at least cost. Finally, to illustrate how our matching model might be used, we test some practical carpooling promotion instruments. We found that higher participant role flexibility in the system can improve matching performance significantly. Encouraging commuters to walk helps form more carpooling trips and further reduces carbon emissions. Different fee-sharing ratios can influence matching performance, hence determination of optimal pricing should be based on the specific matching model and its cost parameters. Disincentives like parking charges and congestion charges seem to have a greater effect on carpooling choice than incentives like preferential parking and subsidies. The proposed model and associated findings provide valuable insights for designing an effective matching system and incentive scheme for carpooling services in practice. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Textbook theory of linking carbon systems suggests linking reduces marginal abatement costs. Contrasting theoretical work and policy analyses suggests that linking, or at least unfettered linking, may not always be beneficial. The New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) is unique in that, until 2013, it allowed unlimited use of Kyoto allowances. NZ ETS, thus provides an ideal context to explore the effect of linking and linking restrictions on carbon pricing of small systems. Using data on importation and exportation of allowances, we provide the first empirical analysis of the determinants of allowance prices in the early phase of the NZ ETS. Our results indicate that imports of offsets rather than fundamentals have been the major price determinant. Moreover, the pricing of New Zealand units (NZUs) can be placed into three distinct periods, delineated by two structural breaks. In the first period, the system is largely autarkic; in the second period, as international offset prices drop below the NZU price, the system becomes a “price taker”; in the final period, following policy interventions, the system regains some independence. The case of the NZ ETS shows that small trading systems need to impose, or have the option to impose, quantitative import restriction so as to reap the benefits (lower abatement cost), but not the drawbacks (“importation” of distortions and market integrity issues), of linking. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The presence of consumers able to respond to changes in wholesale electricity prices facilitates the penetration of renewable intermittent sources of energy such as wind or sun power. We investigate how adapting demand to intermittent electricity supply by making consumers price-responsive - thanks to smart meters and home automation appliances - impacts the energy mix. We show that it almost always reduces carbon emissions. Furthermore, when consumers are not too risk-averse, demand response is socially beneficial because the loss from exposing consumers to volatile prices is more than offset by lower production and environmental costs. However, the gain is decreasing when the proportion of reactive consumers increases. Therefore, depending on the costs of the necessary smart hardware, it may be non-optimal to equip the whole population. © 2021

AB  - This study investigates the potential cost and emissions reductions that result from an increase in electricity transmission capacity between Canada's two westernmost provinces: Alberta, a fossil fuel dominated jurisdiction, and British Columbia, a predominantly hydroelectric jurisdiction. A bottom-up model is used to find the least cost electricity generation mix in Alberta and British Columbia under different carbon policies. The long-term evolution of the electricity system is determined by minimizing net present cost of electricity generation for the time span of 2010–2060. Different levels of intertie capacity expansion are considered together with a variety of carbon tax and carbon cap scenarios. Results indicate that increased intertie capacity reduces the cost of electricity and emissions under carbon pricing policies. However, the expandable intertie does not encourage greater adoption of variable renewable generation. Instead, it is used to move low-cost energy from the United States to Alberta. The optimal intertie capacity and cost reduction of increased interconnectivity increases with more restrictive carbon policies. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This paper employs a novel Monte-Carlo based generation portfolio assessment tool to explore the implications of increasing wind penetration and carbon prices within future electricity generation portfolios under considerable uncertainty. This tool combines optimal generation mix techniques with Monte Carlo simulation and portfolio analysis methods to determine expected overall generation costs, associated cost uncertainty and expected CO2 emissions for different possible generation portfolios. A case study of an electricity industry with coal, Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT), Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT) and wind generation options that faces uncertain future fossil-fuel prices, carbon pricing, electricity demand and plant construction costs is presented to illustrate some of the key issues associated with growing wind penetrations. The case study uses half-hourly demand and wind generation data from South Eastern Australia, and regional estimates of new-build plant costs and characteristics. Results suggest that although wind generation generally increases overall industry costs, it reduces associated cost uncertainties and CO2 emissions. However, there are some cases in which wind generation can reduce the overall costs of generation portfolios. The extent to which wind penetration affects industry expected costs and uncertainties depends on the level of carbon price and the conventional technology mix in the portfolios. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - It is important to evaluate impacts of fossil fuel price hikes and climate stabilization that force the global energy system to adopt alternative and efficient technologies by routing future energy system dynamics into a different technology roadmap. Hence, a high-regional-resolution and technology-rich DNE21+ model is used for the simulation of some price-hike scenarios for the period from 2000 to 2030 by increasing the ordinate of cost-potential curve of crude oil, natural gas and coal by 55 US$(00)/bbl, 3.8 US$(00)/kcf and 56 US$(00)/tonne, respectively, above their reference values; and 550 ppmv stabilization is implemented by carbon limitation from 6998 to 8250 MtC/yr. This study detected that hike in fossil fuel prices acts as an anti-catalyst for human-induced anthropogenic emissions and alleviates heavy dependency upon fossil fuels. Further, it partially solves problems of climate change by reducing CO2 emission levels (23%), reflects human behavior through energy conservation (1.4 Gtoe), calls for efficiency improvement (7%), adopts more efficient and alternative technologies, compared to reference; however, with 550 ppmv stabilization, energy conservation rises to 1.6 Gtoe, demands 16% higher efficiency improvement and reduces CO2 emission by 36%, relative to reference.

AB  - Fiscal considerations may shift governmental priorities away from environmental concerns: finance ministers face strong demand for public expenditures such as infrastructure investments but they are constrained by international tax competition. We develop a multi-region model of tax competition and resource extraction to assess the fiscal incentive of imposing a tax on carbon rather than on capital. We explicitly model international capital and resource markets, as well as intertemporal capital accumulation and resource extraction. While fossil resources give rise to scarcity rents, capital does not. With carbon taxes, the rents can be captured and invested in infrastructure, which leads to higher welfare than under capital taxation. This result holds even without modeling environmental damages. It is robust under a variation of the behavioral assumptions of resource importers to coordinate their actions, and a resource exporter’s ability to counteract carbon policies. Further, no green paradox occurs—instead, the carbon tax constitutes a viable green policy, since it postpones extraction and reduces cumulative emissions. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.
