AB  - Carbon pricing policies can play an important role in reducing global greenhouse gas emissions. However, policymakers often cite the lack of public support as a major obstacle to adopting and expanding the coverage of such policies. Using data from a large cross-country survey of about 28,500 people across 28 countries conducted during the summer of 2022, we show that providing information about the costs and benefits of carbon pricing can swing public support. Highlighting the efficacy and revenue recycling potential of carbon pricing increases support, especially in emerging market economies. In contrast, highlighting costs reduces support, but less so for people who report being already significantly impacted by climate change. Moreover, people adopt more negative views of subsidies for renewable energy and low-carbon technologies when the salience of their costs is increased, with the shift being more pronounced for people, especially in advanced economies, who believe that effective climate polices require global efforts. Our results suggest that there is scope to increase public support for climate mitigation measures by providing people with the policy information they may lack. © 2024 International Monetary Fund.

AB  - Finland introduced the planet's first carbon tax in 1990 to experiment with, to most economists, the best policy to reverse carbon emissions. I estimate the causal effect of taxing carbon on Finnish emissions using the Synthetic Control Approach (Abadie, 2021). The results suggest that taxing carbon reduces emissions by big margins. Finnish emissions are 16% lower in 1995, 25% lower in 2000, and 30% lower in 2004 than emissions in the counterfactual consistent with carbon taxes whose value increasing by 20 fold in 1990–2005. The estimates suggest that the carbon tax's abatement elasticity is about 9%. © 2024 The Author(s)

AB  - This paper introduces an analytical model that characterizes the incentives of the manufacturing industry, consumers, and waste management sectors in closing the material loop. To address identified market failures, various policy instruments are evaluated both theoretically and numerically, using the example of the EU PET market. The assessment shows that a policy package consisting of carbon pricing, advanced disposal fees, and product standards substantially reduces total material consumption and enhances material recovery, leading to a notable reduction in emissions. The analysis of material cost savings, surplus allocation, and social welfare also shows the advantages of such a policy package compared to individual policy instruments. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - Herein we study carbon taxation considering the structure of the global production network. With this purpose we characterize how the implementation of a carbon tax in one country-sector can generate sizeable fluctuations on global emissions and welfare through its impact on the structure of production. We then apply this theoretical characterization to accommodate the structure of a multi-regional input–output database. This framework allows us to identify the country-sectors that should be taxed to reach the strongest potential for emission reduction (or welfare maximization) if no coordinated policy is possible. Interestingly, this choice not only depends on emission intensity but also on to which extent the sector is central in the global production network as well as on the pass-through effect on public or private spending. Additionally, we find that synergies between taxes applied to different country-sectors have a strong impact in emission reductions, calling for greater harmonization in carbon taxation around the world. We then use our model to simulate the impact of the European Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) finding that, when looked into sector by sector, it reduces EU competitiveness loss due to carbon pricing but, when generalized to all EU sectors, the impact through the value chain ends up provoking a stronger contraction in the EU than without the CBAM. © 2024

AB  - We investigated whether carbon taxes with and without carbon dividends improve cooperative behavior to mitigate simulated climate change. We implemented a randomized controlled trial on a large sample of the U.S. general population (N=2,116). Played in real-time in groups of four, we tested three carbon-pricing treatments and a baseline condition within a modified threshold public goods game of loss avoidance. We found that a carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends reduces carbon-emitting group consumption relative to a baseline condition with no tax, and relative to a carbon tax only. A carbon tax coupled with carbon dividends paid out to below-average polluters (asymmetric dividend) worked best, with 94% of groups remaining below a critical consumption (emission) threshold. We also found that experiencing the asymmetric dividend condition positively affected perceptions of carbon pricing with carbon dividends. © 2024 The Authors

AB  - How do policymakers manage the tension between enforcing a carbon price and ensuring low-cost electricity provision? This paper answers this question in two steps. First, it combines literature on electricity market design and rent management to arrive at a novel analytical framework. Carbon pricing can disrupt longstanding rent transfers between the state and electricity consumers by making it more expensive to produce and/or consume fossil fuel-based electricity. We theorize that policymakers respond to this dilemma by making incremental policy design adjustments to gradually enforce rent losses across the electricity production value chain. We apply this framework to study the implementation of the Korean emissions trading scheme (ETS) policy 2015–2022. Drawing on 20 expert interviews and policy documents we identify an initial sequence of policy design adjustments which enable, but also delay, the enforcement of the carbon price signal in the electricity system. This incremental and politically contentious process reduces the ETS policy’s ability to abate greenhouse gas emissions from the Korean electricity sector in the short term. The findings suggest that the effectiveness of carbon pricing in the electricity sector hinge on the parallel construction of supportive institutions to permit meaningful carbon cost pass-through. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - Reducing animal-based food production would not only reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions but also free land that could sequester carbon. We examine the efficiency of a subsidy to cattle farmers for setting aside land for natural ecosystem regeneration. We develop a partial equilibrium model of the cattle sector that integrates land use, greenhouse gas emissions, and animal feeding. We compare the subsidy to alternative policies: a meat tax and a standard on animal feeding. We identify the conditions under which the subsidy is the best alternative to these other second-best policies. The efficiency of the subsidy lies in its effects on both the extensive margin (reduced quantity of meat) and the intensive margin (production intensification, which reduces both the emission and land-use intensities of meat). An empirical application to France, where spontaneous regeneration corresponds mostly to forest regrowth, shows that the subsidy dominates the other alternative policies considered for a wide range of parameter values but is sensitive to carbon leakage when the economy is open to trade. © 2024 The Author(s).

AB  - This study examines how electric utilities and regulators can encourage residential consumers to conserve electricity during the hottest summer days and shift electricity load from the day to off-peak, nighttime hours. We analyze a two-year field experiment involving 280 Texas households that explores approaches to conservation and load-shifting to enable emission reductions and reduce generation costs. Our critical peak pricing intervention reduces electricity consumption by 14% on the peak hours of the hottest days, leading to greenhouse gas emission reductions of about 16%. A key contribution of this study is the use of high-frequency appliance-level data. We show that 74% of the critical peak response is from reducing air conditioning. In a complementary nighttime pilot program, consumers respond strongly to lower prices by programming the timing of electric vehicle charging. Our work highlights how automation can influence the consumer tradeoffs relating to effort costs, discomfort, monetary incentives, and warm glow. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Internal carbon pricing (ICP) has emerged as an increasingly popular tool for firms to cut emissions and combat climate change risks. We theorize the role of ICP by integrating legitimacy and stakeholder perspectives into dynamic capability theory. We argue that firms implement ICP to comply with stakeholders’ expectations, leading to corporate environmental strategic transformation which in turn improve a firm's dynamic capabilities. Furthermore, we argue that the heterogeneous nature of corporate motivation for such strategy transformation, reflected by carbon dependency and corporate climate target, moderates the relationship between the extent of ICP and the environmental outcomes. The Carbon Disclosure Project data of 500 U.S. publicly listed firms confirms that ICP reduces carbon emissions per employee and carbon emissions per revenue by 13.5% and 15.7%, respectively. Collectively, we advance understanding of corporate business strategy in the presence of climate change risks, posing both theoretical and practical policy implications. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - We use a set of economic experiments to test the effects of some novel features of California's new controls on greenhouse gas emissions. The California cap and trade scheme imposes limits on allowance ownership, uses a tiered price containment reserve sale, and settles allowance auctions based on the lowest accepted bid. We examine the effects of these features on market liquidity, efficiency, and price variability. We find that tight holding limits substantially reduce banking, which, in turn reduces market liquidity. This impairs the ability of traders to smooth prices over time, resulting in lower efficiency and higher price variability. The price containment reserve, while increasing the supply of allowances available to traders, does not appear to mitigate the effects of tight holding limits on market outcomes. As a result, the imposition of holding limits in the allowance market may have the consequence of increasing the likelihood of the market manipulation that they were intended to prevent. Finally, we find that the choice between lowest accepted bid and highest rejected bid for the allowance auction pricing rule does not have a significant effect on market outcomes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - A streamlined model, applied at the member state level, is used to evaluate possibilities for greater reliance on carbon pricing to meet the European Union's mitigation pledge for the Paris Agreement. The economic welfare costs of currently envisioned policies—including the Emissions Trading System (ETS), requirements for energy efficiency, vehicle emission rates, and national targets for non-ETS emissions—are estimated at 1.1% of EU GDP in 2030, or €167 per ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) reduced. On net these policies lose a small amount of revenue (0.05% of EU GDP). A series of reforms progressively extending emissions pricing across sectors and countries reduces costs by about 0.6% of 2030 EU GDP, or €90 per ton of CO2 reduced, while increasing revenues by almost 1% of EU GDP. Higher emissions prices in the EU ETS would create the largest welfare gain, and no country is made worse off from this reform. © 2019

AB  - This paper surveys pricing mechanisms used by government agencies to manage congestion, as well as highlights the many political and social issues that have to be addressed in order to implement a pricing mechanism. This survey was undertaken in order to be able to understand how congestion pricing could be used to help manage airspace capacity. This is an important question since a 2008 analysis by the Joint Economic Committee of the US Congress suggested that domestic air traffic delays in 2007 cost the economy as much as $41 billion, including $19 billion in increased operational costs for the airlines and $12 billion worth of lost time for passengers.The paper begins by surveying roadway congestion approaches throughout the world. We survey the successes that peak pricing charges have had on reducing congestion. We also report the other benefits that such practices have had: improving the public transportation network, improving the economy of the region, reducing carbon emissions, and creating new urban living spaces. We next examine other applications of congestion pricing, including managing demand for canal and bridges passage, port usage, access to city centers, and peak use of energy resources.The paper ends with a proposal for a two-staged approach to the management of air space and runway congestion. The first stage imposes a service standard on runway access that is consistent with an airport's capacity during good weather days. Then, when weather reduces capacity either in the airspace or on runways, we propose a congestion pricing mechanism that charges flights based on the amount of congestion the flight imposes on the entire system. © 2012.

AB  - We investigate the impact of pricing policies (i.e., flat pricing versus peak pricing) on the investment levels of a utility firm in two competing energy sources (renewable and conventional), with a focus on the renewable investment level.We consider generation patterns and intermittency of solar and wind energy in relation to the electricity demand throughout a day. Industry experts generally promote peak pricing policy as it smoothens the demand and reduces inefficiencies in the supply system.We find that the same pricing policy may lead to distinct outcomes for different renewable energy sources due to their generation patterns. Specifically, flat pricing leads to a higher investment level for solar energy, and it can lead to still more investments in wind energy if a considerable amount of wind energy is generated throughout the day. We validate these results by using electricity generation and demand data of the state of Texas. We also show that flat pricing can lead to substantially lower carbon emissions and a higher consumer surplus. Finally, we explore the effect of direct (e.g., tax credit) and indirect (e.g., carbon tax) subsidies on investment levels and carbon emissions. We show that both types of subsidies generally lead to a lower emission level but that indirect subsidies may result in lower renewable energy investments. Our study suggests that reducing carbon emissions through increasing renewable energy investments requires careful attention to the pricing policy and the market characteristics of each region.

AB  - Heterogeneous fleet vehicles can be used to reduce carbon emissions. We propose an improved branch-and-price (BAP) algorithm to precisely solve the heterogeneous fleet green vehicle routing problem with time windows (HFGVRPTW). In the improved BAP, to speed up the solution for the pricing problem, we develop a multi-vehicle approximate dynamic programming (MVADP) algorithm that is based on the labeling algorithm. The MVADP algorithm reduces labels by integrating the calculation of pricing problems for all vehicle types. In addition, to rapidly obtain a tighter upper bound, we propose an integer branch method. For each branch, we solve the master problem with the integer constraint by the CPLEX solver using the columns produced by column generation. We retain the smaller of the obtained integer solution and the current upper bound, and the branches are thus reduced significantly. Extensive computational experiments were performed on the Solomon benchmark instances. The results show that the branches and computational time were reduced significantly by the improved BAP algorithm. © 2019

AB  - Spurred by substantial subsidies, renewable energies have reduced their costs and captured a steadily growing market share. However, the variability of solar and wind power leads to new challenges for power systems. Policy instruments for steering the energy transition towards a zero-carbon future must account for this. We consider an economy in which competitive firms use pollutive fossils, intermittent renewables, and storage for electricity production. A Pigouvian tax is still efficient, because price fluctuations that result from intermittent renewables provide sufficient incentives to invest in storage capacities. However, governments have proved reluctant to impose carbon taxes. Therefore, we examine second-best subsidies when carbon pricing is imperfect. The optimal subsidy rate for renewables decreases as electricity production becomes less reliant on fossils. The storage subsidy is usually negative as long as fossils are dispatched while filling the storage, but turns positive thereafter. This is because more storage capacity reduces the price when stored electricity is supplied to the market, but raises it when storage adds to demand. This has countervailing effects on firms’ incentives to invest in fossil capacities. A numerical simulation illustrates that substantial subsidy payments are required even after fossils have been completely driven out of the market. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - This paper addresses the problem of the firms operating on cross-border or inter-regional platforms that are subject to the enforcement of each local government's carbon emissions regulatory policy, thus causing an imbalance in the sharing of the burden of the greening of the total supply chain. We introduce the concept of equity as the incentive mechanism to coordinate this green supply chain which is a function of the carbon emission permits and the revenue generated by the firms. Due to the complexity and imbalance in the original incentive mechanism to this problem, we provide a new equivalent supply chain network equilibrium model under elastic demand based on user equilibrium theory. We state the user equilibrium conditions and provide the equivalent formulation. We show the trade-offs under various carbon emissions regulatory policies. A product with higher price elasticity and carbon emission intensity not only hampers the firm from gaining a higher revenue, but it also reduces the equity of the system under an invariant emission regulatory policy. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.
